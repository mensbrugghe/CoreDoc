While initially focused on supporting trade policy analysis, the addition of satellite accounts pertaining to greenhouse gas emissions and land use has resulted in a surge of applications relating to climate change as well as other environmental issues. The Data Base comprises an exhaustive set of accounts measuring the value of annual flows of goods and services with regional and sectoral detail for the entire world economy. These flows include bilateral trade, transport, and protection matrices that link individual country/regional economic datasets. Version 9 disaggregates 140 regions, 57 sectors, 8 factors of production, for 3 base years (2004, 2007 and 2011). The great success enjoyed by this Data Base stems from the collaboration efforts by many parties interested in improving the quality of economic analysis of global policy issues related to trade, economic development, energy and the environment.},

This new temporary worker program would be open to undocumented workers in the US, as well as to prospective migrants currently residing abroad. The program would temporarily allow immigrants to fill jobs that, according to employers, would otherwise go unfilled at the current wage. The US Congress vetoed the presidential proposal, however, and requested a stricter enforcement of immigration law and the consequent deportation of undocumented immigrants. This study analyzes the economic effects of these immigration reforms on the US economy using an applied global general equilibrium model of migration.
In this paper the global trade and migration model (GMig2) developed by Walmsley, Winters and Ahmed (2007) is modified to include a third labor category – undocumented unskilled – to reflect estimates of undocumented workers residing in the United States. The model is then used to analyze the impacts of two policy scenarios on the US economy: first, the deportation of undocumented workers currently residing in the US; and second, the legalization of undocumented agricultural workers. The first scenario is implemented through a decline in the number of undocumented workers residing in the US to zero, and a corresponding increase in the number of workers in Mexico. The second scenario is achieved by allowing undocumented workers to obtain legal status, thereby increasing their wages and productivity.},

Cultural and personal associations with animal product consumption create barriers to moderating consumption, and hence reduced environmental impacts. Here we review alternatives to conventional animal products, including cultured meat, imitation meat and insects (i.e. entomophagy), and explore the potential change in global agricultural land requirements associated with each alternative. Stylised transformative consumption scenarios where half of current conventional animal products are substituted to provide at least equal protein and calories are considered. The analysis also considers and compares the agricultural land area given shifts between conventional animal product consumption. The results suggest that imitation meat and insects have the highest land use efficiency, but the land use requirements are only slightly greater for eggs and poultry meat. The efficiency of insects and their ability to convert agricultural by-products and food waste into food, suggests further research into insect production is warranted. Cultured meat does not appear to offer substantial benefits over poultry meat or eggs, with similar conversion efficiency, but higher direct energy requirements. Comparison with the land use savings from reduced consumer waste, including over-consumption, suggests greater benefits could be achieved from alternative dietary transformations considered. We conclude that although a diet with lower rates of animal product consumption is likely to create the greatest reduction in agricultural land, a mix of smaller changes in consumer behaviour, such as replacing beef with chicken, reducing food waste and potentially introducing insects more commonly into diets, would also achieve land savings and a more sustainable food system.},

The extrusion of plant-based proteins can be performed by two technologies: high moisture extrudates (HME) and low moisture texturized vegetable proteins (TVP). The largest difference between the technologies relates to the moisture content prevailing inside the extrusion barrel. The extrusion processes also vary in their throughput, and yields. Life cycle assessment (LCA) was performed to compare the environmental performance of the two extrusion technologies applied to two plant-based raw materials (soymeal and pumpkin seed flour). Additionally, the study compared plant-based burger patties to meat burger patties (beef, pork and chicken). The impact of plant-based burger patties was at least ten-fold lower than meat burger patties. TVP-production exhibited a higher environmental impact compared to HME (20�40\% higher depending on the raw material). The best performing plant burger patties were HME-soy-patties, in contrast with the worst-performing plant TVP-soy patties. TVP-pumpkin seed patties presented lower impacts compared to TVP-soy ones.},

A corresponding approach to the estimation of emissions has remained unchanged since then and relies on the Tier 1 method of the 1996 IPCC Guidelines (IPCC/OECD/IEA, 1997). However, a number of concerns regarding discrepancies between GTAP CO2 emissions data and other international data sources, such as EDGAR and IEA, have been raised. In this paper, we compare GTAP CO2 emissions data with other international data sources and quantify the revealed discrepancies. To address the identified differences, we develop and implement a revised emissions accounting framework based on the Tier 1 method of the 2006 IPCC Guidelines. Our revised approach includes estimation of emission factors at a more granular commodity level than implemented in the standard GTAP 10A Data Base. Two additional refinements include an updated accounting of emissions from blast furnaces and other recovered gases, as well as a more transparent treatment of CO2 emissions from flaring. We implement an updated emissions accounting framework for the case of GTAP 11 energy database and show that it helps to substantially reduce discrepancies between GTAP and other international data sources both at the global and country levels.},

Each Transformation identifies priority investments and regulatory challenges, calling for actions by well-defined parts of government working with business and civil society. Transformations may therefore be operationalized within the structures of government while respecting the strong interdependencies across the 17 SDGs. We also outline an action agenda for science to provide the knowledge required for designing, implementing and monitoring the SDG Transformations.},

We focus on gaps in the policy framework presently adopted by countries that are parties to the UNFCCC, using as illustrative case study the meat tax recently proposed in Denmark. We argue that when the GHG reduction targets for individual countries are based on a territorial approach alone (such as in the UNFCCC framework), i.e. sum of emissions from production inside the country, whether or not consumed inside or outside the country, policy regulations directed at consumption, such as a meat tax, may not effectively target the national GHG reduction obligations, and thereby they may not be sufficiently attractive to governments. In particular, emissions derived from internationally traded goods are insufficiently targeted by territorially oriented policy frameworks because a country might reduce the consumption of an imported good without contributing to the national GHG emission reduction target. If consumption-based reduction targets were implemented, a reduction of GHG emissions due to a reduction of the national demand of meat would be revealed irrespective of whether the GHG emission reduction results from a decrease of domestic or foreign demand of meat. The paper also discusses the importance of the methodological approach to accounting GHG emissions at the country level. We argue that to reveal the effect of policy instruments such as a meat tax, on GHG emissions reduced, an alternative consumption-based accounting could favorably complement the traditional GHG accounting.},

Through a desk study, this paper evaluates some feed sources that are being developed in The Netherlands as an alternative to current feeds, namely food waste; seaweed; and localized production and alternative plant-based feed sources. These feed categories are evaluated according to four circularity criteria. The first two criteria concern standard circularity principles aimed at both stopping and preventing environmental damage as well as a focus on natural resources use efficiency: (1) safeguard the health of ecosystems and (2) avoid the production of unnecessary products and use/recycle biomass effectively, as well as evaluating possible food&ndash;feed competition. In addition, two &lsquo;people&rsquo; and &lsquo;animal&rsquo; centred principles have been integrated: (3) fairness and accessibility and (4) animal health and wellbeing. The article concludes that people and animal centred principles are key to thinking of, developing, implementing, and evaluating circularity initiatives. Moreover, the article suggests that categories such as the local production of soya (approx. 132 ha) or seaweed (approx. 10&ndash;15 ha) are as yet irrelevant regarding production volumes within the Dutch context. However, some feed sources such as seaweed, insects, livestock leftovers produced at farms and abattoirs, and food waste might strengthen the transition towards more circular and sustainable practices.},

  abstract = {Abstract Livestock contributes approximately one-third of global anthropogenic methane (CH4) emissions. Quantifying the spatial and temporal variations of these emissions is crucial for climate change mitigation. Although country-level information is reported regularly through national inventories and global databases, spatially explicit quantification of century-long dynamics of CH4 emissions from livestock has been poorly investigated. Using the Tier 2 method adopted from the 2019 Refinement to 2006 IPCC guidelines, we estimated CH4 emissions from global livestock at a spatial resolution of 0.083� (~9 km at the equator) during the period 1890�2019. We find that global CH4 emissions from livestock increased from 31.8 [26.5�37.1] (mean [minimum-maximum of 95\% confidence interval) Tg CH4 yr-1 in 1890 to 131.7 [109.6�153.7] Tg CH4 yr-1 in 2019, a fourfold increase in the past 130 years. The growth in global CH4 emissions mostly occurred after 1950 and was mainly attributed to the cattle sector. Our estimate shows faster growth in livestock CH4 emissions as compared to the previous Tier 1 estimates and is ~20\% higher than the estimate from FAOSTAT for the year 2019. Regionally, South Asia, Brazil, North Africa, China, the United States, Western Europe, and Equatorial Africa shared the majority of the global emissions in the 2010s. South Asia, tropical Africa, and Brazil have dominated the growth in global CH4 emissions from livestock in the recent three decades. Changes in livestock CH4 emissions were primarily associated with changes in population and national income and were also affected by the policy, diet shifts, livestock productivity improvement, and international trade. The new geospatial information on the magnitude and trends of livestock CH4 emissions identifies emission hotspots and spatial�temporal patterns, which will help to guide meaningful CH4 mitigation practices in the livestock sector at both local and global scales.},

  abstract = {Recent years have seen a steep rise in the interest in nutrient circularity. In the context of food systems and waste management, nutrient circularity seems to generally encompass the reduction of nutrient losses and increased recovery of nutrients from various organic residual streams for reuse in agricultural production. Many studies that aim to contribute to improving nutrient circularity in food systems have limited the analysis to a given geographical area. But nutrient circularity likely looks different when the analysis includes what happens outside the borders of the considered area. This paper presents and discusses an analytical framework that allows for the analysis of nutrient circularity not only inside a given geographical area being considered, but also in those parts of the global food system with which the local food system interacts in terms of feed and food trade. This framework explicitly characterizes the impact of system openness associated with feed and food trade. This enables: (i) a separate discussion of four possible interpretations of nutrient circularity � internal and external input and output circularity; and (ii) an analysis of how these four circularity indicators relate to one another depending on system openness. The proposed analysis can thus reveal the extent to which a high level of nutrient circularity in the considered area comes at the cost of a decreased level of nutrient circularity in the places with which feed and food are traded, or vice versa.},

At the same time, most of the available integrated assessment and computable general equilibrium models have some major limitations in terms of the consistent representation of nutritional data flows. In this paper, we address some of the limitations identified in the literature and develop an approach for incorporating nutritional accounts into the Global Trade Analysis Project (GTAP) Data Base, tracing quantities of food, calories, fats, proteins and carbohydrates along the value chains. We further showcase how the developed nutritional database can be linked to the standard GTAP model.

Using new FAO food loss estimates we model loss reduction as a zero-cost productivity increase at primary and processing stages, simultaneously deriving the response of food security (national availability, accessibility and utilisation of food) and sustainability indicators (GHG emissions, agricultural land use) at global and regional levels. To help focus data collection and intervention efforts we identify interventions by region, supply chain stage and sector contributing most to improving nutrition and sustainability. While the loss rates show no clear relation to regional income, strongest impacts on food security and environment are in low income regions. Decomposing indicator responses to the exogenous loss reduction shocks we find a focus on domestic primary stages achieving strong and unambiguous positive impacts on both food security and environment. Since foreign loss reductions may harm food insecure agricultural households through import substitution, the most food insecure countries should be part of any global loss reduction efforts. Fruit and vegetables and animal products are found to have the strongest impact on both food security and environment. A marginal impact on GHG emissions remains once non-agricultural expansion following the productivity increase is accounted for, showing the importance of an economy-wide perspective.},

  abstract = {Agriculture is the largest single source of global anthropogenic methane (CH4) emissions, with ruminants the dominant contributor. Livestock CH4 emissions are projected to grow another 30\% by 2050 under current policies, yet few countries have set targets or are implementing policies to reduce emissions in absolute terms. The reason for this limited ambition may be linked not only to the underpinning role of livestock for nutrition and livelihoods in many countries but also diverging perspectives on the importance of mitigating these emissions, given the short atmospheric lifetime of CH4. Here, we show that in mitigation pathways that limit warming to 1.5�C, which include cost-effective reductions from all emission sources, the contribution of future livestock CH4 emissions to global warming in 2050 is about one-third of that from future net carbon dioxide emissions. Future livestock CH4 emissions, therefore, significantly constrain the remaining carbon budget and the ability to meet stringent temperature limits. We review options to address livestock CH4 emissions through more efficient production, technological advances and demand-side changes, and their interactions with land-based carbon sequestration. We conclude that bringing livestock into mainstream mitigation policies, while recognizing their unique social, cultural and economic roles, would make an important contribution towards reaching the temperature goal of the Paris Agreement and is vital for a limit of 1.5�C.

Constant Elasticity of Transformation (CET) supply function, where land cover is allocated across forestry,

based calibration strategy used to determine the CET value for the land cover allocation nest dealing with the
broader three commercial uses, and examines how land use responsiveness and the parameter value evolve over time. The
calibration is accomplished using the GTAP Land Use Database and time paths of land quantities by use over a
100 year period. These land quantity projections are, in turn, based on matrices of land use transition
probabilities and own return elasticities of transition probabilities for the USA. We find that over time there is
a rise in the land use response to increases in own-returns and in own return elasticities, while there is a fall in the calibrated CET value.
The value of the CET parameter decreases at a decreasing rate every five-year period, although it can be approximated by
a linear relationship in the short to medium run. We can use this linear interpolation to estimate the average CET parameter associated with
any desired length of run.},

However, it is unclear how trends in global FLW and potential for climate impact have evolved. Here, by utilising the Food and Agriculture Organization's food balance sheet data, we expand upon existing literature. Firstly, we provide a differentiated (by commodity, country and supply chain stage) bottom-up approach; secondly, we conduct a 50-year longitudinal analysis of global FLW and its production-phase greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions; and thirdly, we trace food wastage and its associated emissions through the entire food supply chain. Between 1961 and 2011 the annual amount of FLW by mass grew a factor of three � from 540Mt to 1.6Gt; associated production-phase (GHG) emissions more than tripled (from 680Mt to 2.2Gt CO2e). A 44\% increase in global average per capita FLW emissions was also identified � from 225kg CO2e in 1961 to 323kg CO2e in 2011. The regional weighting within this global average changing markedly over time; in 1961 developed countries accounted for 48\% of FLW and less than a quarter (24\%) in 2011. The largest increases in FLW-associated GHG emissions were from developing economies, specifically China and Latin America � primarily from increasing losses in fruit and vegetables. Over the period examined, cumulatively such emissions added almost 68Gt CO2e to the atmospheric GHG stock; an amount the rough equivalent of two years of emissions from all anthropogenic sources at present rates. Building up from the most granular data available, this study highlights the growth in the climate burden of FLW emissions, and thus the need to improve efficiency in food supply chains to mitigate future emissions.},

  abstract = {Livestock production is among the most ecologically harmful of all anthropogenic activities. It has massive direct and indirect contributions to global warming besides causing widespread ecodegradation in other ways. But livestock production cannot be reduced because, as it is, the global demand for animal protein is far higher than the supply. Whereas in developed countries people get about 95 g of protein per day in their diets, of which nearly 60 percent is made up of animal protein, in developing countries the protein intake is only about 45 g/day and of it a mere 15 percent is made up of animal protein. This gap in the availability of animal protein for a large fraction of the world's population who desires it, is continuing to increase because of the increased globalization-induced rich-poor gap across the world. Besides the fact that conventional ways of animal protein production using livestock-chicken, goat, pork, beef-are highly eco-degrading; in terms of availability of pasture lands as well as enhancement in productivity of edible zoomass with inputs from science and technology, the upper limits of animal protein production have already been reached. The ocean-based food production has similarly reached unsustainable levels. As a consequence, now onwards the demand will increasingly outstrip supply. In this backdrop it is essential that we look at the potential of minilivestock, especially insects. As brought out in this paper, human beings have evolved as entomophagous species and there are even suggestions that some of the special proteins and other constituents present in the insects might have helped the human brain to develop as rapidly as it did to enable its evolution into Home sapiens. Moreover, several species of insects are prized delicacies in advanced countries like Japan, Australia, and Europe. Hence, insects are not restricted to being �subsistence food� of grossly impoverished people as one might imagine though a lot of species do help the world's poor to survive. If other virtues of insects are considered- especially their high food-to-zoomass conversion efficiency, quick growth rate, enormous variety, and world-wide distribution-their potential as a much more sustainable source of animal protein than conventional livestock would become obvious.},

  abstract = {Summary Dietary behavioral choices have a strong effect on the environmental impact associated with the food system. Here, we consider the greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions associated with production of food that is lost at the retail and consumer level, as well as the potential effects on GHG emissions of a shift to dietary recommendations. Calculations are based on the U.S. Department of Agriculture's (USDA) food availability data set and literature meta-analysis of emission factors for various food types. Food losses contribute 1.4 kilograms (kg) carbon dioxide equivalents (CO2-eq) capita-1day-1 (28\%) to the overall carbon footprint of the average U.S. diet; in total, this is equivalent to the emissions of 33 million average passenger vehicles annually. Whereas beef accounts for only 4\% of the retail food supply by weight, it represents 36\% of the diet-related GHG emissions. An iso-caloric shift from the current average U.S. diet to USDA dietary recommendations could result in a 12\% increase in diet-related GHG emissions, whereas a shift that includes a decrease in caloric intake, based on the needs of the population (assuming moderate activity), results in a small (1\%) decrease in diet-related GHG emissions. These findings emphasize the need to consider environmental costs of food production in formulating recommended food patterns.},

Quantifying the environmental impacts of the various livestock categories, mostly arising from feed production, is thus a grand challenge of sustainability science. Here, we quantify land, irrigation water, and reactive nitrogen (Nr) impacts due to feed production, and recast published full life cycle GHG emission estimates, for each of the major animal-based categories in the US diet. Our calculations reveal that the environmental costs per consumed calorie of dairy, poultry, pork, and eggs are mutually comparable (to within a factor of 2), but strikingly lower than the impacts of beef. Beef production requires 28, 11, 5, and 6 times more land, irrigation water, GHG, and Nr, respectively, than the average of the other livestock categories. Preliminary analysis of three staple plant foods shows two- to sixfold lower land, GHG, and Nr requirements than those of the nonbeef animal-derived calories, whereas irrigation requirements are comparable. Our analysis is based on the best data currently available, but follow-up studies are necessary to improve parameter estimates and fill remaining knowledge gaps. Data imperfections notwithstanding, the key conclusion�that beef production demands about 1 order of magnitude more resources than alternative livestock categories�is robust under existing uncertainties. The study thus elucidates the multiple environmental benefits of potential, easy-to-implement dietary changes, and highlights the uniquely high resource demands of beef.},

This is particularly important if the CGE model incorporates firm heterogeneity because it introduces a new margin of adjustment and changes the interpretation of parameter estimates. A remaining obstacle to fully understanding the insights of trade in CGE models with firm heterogeneity is the lack of an appropriate set of parameter estimates consistent with the underlying theory. Our objective in this paper is to solve for structural parameters that are theoretically consistent with firm heterogeneity models. Specifically, we focus on the elasticity of substitution across varieties. We distinguish between the extensive and intensive margins of trade flows and estimate two gravity equations by using country-level data for the motor vehicles and parts industry. Our results show that the elasticity values that are consistent with the firm heterogeneity theory are considerably lower than Armington (1969) elasticities used in the GTAP model. This implies that current implementations of Melitz-type models which use elasticities of substitution estimated in the absence of firm heterogeneity will give overly large trade volume responses to policy reforms.},

In this paper, we present a new modeling framework where the firm heterogeneity theory of Melitz is introduced into the Global Trade Analysis Project (GTAP) model and calibrated to the GTAP 8 Data Base. The new mechanisms in the model are demonstrated in a stylized scenario with 3 regions (USA, Japan and the Rest of the World) and 2 sectors (manufacturing and non-manufacturing) where the elimination of tariffs levied by Japan on the import of US manufacturing goods is examined. Results are compared with those under monopolistic competition motivated by Krugman and under perfect competition motivated by Armington. The firm heterogeneity model incorporates endogenous variety, scale, productivity, and fixed cost effects into welfare change in addition to the traditional allocative efficiency and terms of trade effects. We observe that these effects are significant sources of welfare change. GTAP-HET presents the first GTAP implementation of firm heterogeneity. It is a powerful tool for policy analysis with improved abilities in tracing out productivity changes and entry/exit of firms following trade liberalization scenarios.},

 the World Bank; (e) a new base year of 2005/2007 (the previous edition used the base year
 1999/2001); (f) updated estimates of land resources from the new evaluation of the \emph{Global

 in protected areas from the GAEZ are taken into account and excluded from the estimates of
 land areas suitable for crop production into which agriculture could expand in the future; (g)
 updated estimates of existing irrigation, renewable water resources and potentials for
 irrigation expansion; and (h) changes in the text as required by the new historical data and
 projections.

 Like the interim report, this re-make does not include projections for the Fisheries and
 Forestry sectors. Calories from fish are, however, included, in the food consumption
 projections, along with those from other commodities (e.g. spices) not analysed individually.

 The projections presented reflect the magnitudes and trajectories we estimate the major food

 variables may be required to evolve in the future in order to achieve some normative

 Given crop production increases specified as above, the model calculates first the requirements for total
 power input and subsequently distributes it to the three sources of power (labour, machinery and draught animals).
 The results show that for a 3.5\% annual increase in crop production in the aggregate of the 90 developing
 countries 1980-2000 (the growth rate 1966-81 was 2.9\%) the total power input (in terms of man day equivalents)
 should grow at 2.2\% and the labour input at 2.1\%, implying an employment
 elasticity of 0.52. Mechanization should advance most rapidly in the higher income developing countries

structure combined with increasing returns to scale production technologies to represent the strategic
interaction among the firms producing energy-intensive products. This representation is then embedded within a
multi-regional computable general equilibrium model, which in turn is used for quantifying these
relocational effects. The results suggest that significant relocation of energy-intensive industries
away from the \{OECD\} may occur, depending on the type of market structure, with leakage rates as
high as 130\%, in which case \{GHG\} control policies in the industrialized countries actually
lead to higher global emissions.},

recent price spike in agricultural commodities is a transitory phenomenon. Using projections from
SIMPLE---a global model of the farm and food system---we argue that, in the long run, food prices will most likely
resume their historical downward trend. We begin with an evaluation of the historical period 1961 to 2006 wherein
the growth in agricultural productivity outpaced that of global crop demand, the latter being fueled by rising
population and incomes. As a consequence, we observed a historical decline in global crop prices, which the
SIMPLE model faithfully reproduces. Moving forward to 2051, we establish a set of projections in global crop prices given
expected developments in population, incomes, agricultural productivity and biofuel use. We project that global crop prices will
continue their long run decline in the coming decades, albeit at a slower pace. However, we recognize that,
under some circumstances, global crop prices could still increase by mid-century. To formally assess the likelihood of future
price changes, we conduct Monte Carlo simulations given distributions in the growth rates of both
drivers and economic responses. Results show that 72 percent of the realizations produce price declines from 2006 to 2051.},

 both the opportunities and the challenges in undertaking such model validation, using the
 {SIMPLE} model of global agriculture. We look back at the long run historical period 1961--2006
 and, using a few key historical drivers---population, incomes and total factor
 productivity---we find that {SIMPLE} is able to accurately reproduce historical changes in cropland use,
 crop price, crop production and average crop yields at the global scale. Equally important
 is our investigation into how the specific assumptions embedded in many agricultural
 models will likely influence these results. We find that those global models which are
 largely biophysical---thereby ignoring the price responsiveness of demand and
 supply---are likely to understate changes in crop production, while failing to capture
 the changes in cropland use and crop price. Likewise, global models which incorporate economic responses,
 but do so based on limited time series estimates of these responses, are likely to understate
 land use change and overstate price changes.},

The theory underlying our model is consistent with Melitz (2003). A nonlinear structural estimation procedure identifies a set of core parameters and unobserved firm-level trade frictions which best fit the geographic pattern of trade. Once the parameters are identified, we utilize a decomposition technique for computing general-equilibrium counterfactuals. We illustrate this technique using trade and protection data from the Global Trade Analysis Project (GTAP). We first assess the economic effects of reductions in measured tariffs. Taking the simple-average welfare change across regions the Melitz structure indicates welfare gains from liberalization that are nearly four times larger than in a standard policy simulation model. Furthermore, when we compare the economic impact of tariffs with reductions in estimated fixed trade costs we find that policy measures affecting the fixed costs of firm entry are of greater importance than conventional tariff barriers.

  abstract = {Energy is crucial for supporting basic human needs, development and well-being. The future evolution of the scale and
character of the energy system will be fundamentally shaped by socioeconomic conditions and drivers, available energy resources,
technologies of energy supply and transformation, and end-use energy demand. However, because energy-related activities are significant
sources of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and other environmental and social externalities, energy system development will also be
influenced by social acceptance and strategic policy choices. All of these uncertainties have important implications for many
aspects of economic and environmental sustainability, and climate change in particular. In the Shared-Socioeconomic Pathway (SSP) framework
these uncertainties are structured into five narratives, arranged according to the challenges to climate change mitigation and adaptation.
In this study we explore future energy sector developments across the five \{SSPs\} using Integrated Assessment Models (IAMs),
and we also provide summary output and analysis for selected scenarios of global emissions mitigation policies.
The mitigation challenge strongly corresponds with global baseline energy sector growth over the 21st century, which varies
between 40\% and 230\% depending on final energy consumer behavior, technological improvements, resource availability and policies.
The future baseline CO2-emission range is even larger, as the most energy-intensive \{SSP\} also incorporates a comparatively
high share of carbon-intensive fossil fuels, and vice versa. Inter-regional disparities in the \{SSPs\} are consistent with
the underlying socioeconomic assumptions; these differences are particularly strong in the \{SSPs\} with large adaptation challenges,
which have little inter-regional convergence in long-term income and final energy demand levels. The scenarios presented do
not include feedbacks of climate change on energy sector development. The energy sector \{SSPs\} with and without emissions
mitigation policies are introduced and analyzed here in order to contribute to future research in climate sciences, mitigation
analysis, and studies on impacts, adaptation and vulnerability.},

 The latter scenario induces substantial worsening of pollution, partly because it facilitates access to cheaper and dirty energy,
 and has a significant negative effect on urban morbidity and mortality. Damages caused by rising morbidity and mortality are of
 similar magnitude and substantial. Emissions of small particulates, {SO2}, and {NO2}, have the strongest impact on local
 mortality and morbidity. These three pollutants appear to be complementary in economic activity. Unilateral trade integration

  abstract = {Water problems are typically studied at the level of the river catchment.
About 70\% of all water is used for agriculture, and agricultural products are traded internationally.
A full understanding of water use is impossible without understanding the international market for food
and related products, such as textiles. The water embedded in commodities is called virtual water.
Based on a general equilibrium model, we offer a method for investigating the role of water resources
and water scarcity in the context of international trade. We run five alternative scenarios, analyzing
the effects of water scarcity due to reduced availability of groundwater. This can be a consequence of
physical constraints, and of policies curbing water demand. Four scenarios are based on a "market solution",
where water owners can capitalize their water rent or taxes are recycled.
In the fifth "non-market" scenario, this is not the case; supply restrictions imply productivity losses.
Restrictions in water supply would shift trade patterns of agriculture and virtual water.
These shifts are larger if the restriction is larger, and if the use of water in production is more rigid.
Welfare losses are substantially larger in the non-market situation. Water-constrained
agricultural producers lose, but unconstrained agricultural produces gain; industry gains as well.
As a result, there are regional winners and losers from water supply constraints.
Because of the current distortions of agricultural markets, water supply constraints could improve allocative
efficiency; this welfare gain may more than offset the welfare losses due to the resource constraint.},

We also incorporate Agro-ecological Zones (AEZs) for each of the land using sectors in line with Lee et al. (2005). The GTAP-E model with biofuels and AEZs offers a useful framework for analyzing the growing importance of biofuels for global changes in crop production, utilization, commodity prices, factor use, trade, land use change etc. We begin by validating the model over the 2001-2006 period. We focus on six main drivers of the biofuel boom: the hike in crude oil prices, replacement of MTBE by ethanol as a gasoline additive in the US, and subsidies for ethanol and biodiesel in the US and EU. Using this historical simulation, we calibrate the key elasticities of energy substitution between biofuels and petroleum products in each region. With these parameter settings in place, the model does a reasonably good job of predicting the share of feedstock in biofuels and related sectors in accordance with the historical evidence between 2001 and 2006 in the three major biofuel producing regions: US, EU, and Brazil. The results from the historical simulation reveal an increased production of feedstock with the replacement of acreage under other agricultural crops. As expected, the trade balance in oil sector improves for all the oil exporting regions, but it deteriorates at the aggregate for the agricultural sectors.},

 a larger sample covering lower-income OECD and non-OECD countries. Confirmation is found from pooled mean group estimates for the larger sample
 of countries that long-run GDP per capita levels are increased inter alia by education policies, trade openness, R&D expenditures and policy frameworks
 that are conducive to low inflation, although the estimated effect of education is implausibly large. Second, the paper proposes a new growth
 regression framework that explicitly models technology diffusion and allows exploring the growth effects of a wider set of policies and institutions,
 while alleviating some of the constraints of the pooled mean group estimator. Under this approach, the estimated return to education is more in line
 with available evidence from microeconomic studies. Regulatory barriers to entrepreneurship, explicit barriers to trade and---especially---patent rights
 protection appear to be fairly robust determinants of long-run cross-country differences in technology. Some other policies and institutions such
 as trade liberalisation are found to speed up technology convergence. There is limited evidence here that the effects of policies and
 institutions vary depending on countries' level of development. These findings are subject to the usual limitations of growth regression analysis.},

 estimate emissions or resources that are embodied in international trade. For {CO\textsubscript{2}} footprints,
 unacceptably large overestimations arise from using domestic emission coefficients, which are
 only partly canceled out by using domestic technology coefficients. For water use footprints both
 specification errors are smaller, but hardly cancel out. Sectoral aggregation errors occur when
 combining the 129 EXIOPOL industries to 59 EU industries and 10 broad sectors. The latter
 aggregation creates the largest errors. Spatial aggregation errors arise from combining 43 individual
 EXIOPOL countries in four broad regions and {"the rest of the world"}. Substantial, unacceptable errors
 occur again, now especially in relation to water use.},

that minimizes the sum of weighted Euclidean distances to \emph{m} given points.
A one-point iterative method was first introduced by Weiszfeld in 1937 to solve this problem.
Since then several research articles have been published on the method and generalizations thereof.
Global convergence of Weiszfeld's algorithm was proven in a seminal paper by Kuhn in 1973.
However, since them given points are singular points of the iteration functions, convergence is
conditional on none of the iterates coinciding with one of the given points.
In addressing this problem, Kuhn concluded that whenever them given points are not collinear,
Weiszfeld's algorithm will converge to the unique optimal solution except for a denumerable set of starting points.
As late as 1989, Chandrasekaran and Tamir demonstrated with counter-examples that convergence may not
occur for continuous sets of starting points when the given points are contained in an affine subspace of $\mathbb{R}^N$.
We resolve this open question by proving that Weiszfeld's algorithm converges to the unique optimal solution
for all but a denumerable set of starting points if, and only if, the convex hull of the given points is of dimension \emph{N}.},

which they agreed to ceilings on their emissions of greenhouse gases ({GHG}s). Such unilateral action by a group of
countries has often been criticised on the grounds that it could be undermined by the existence of so-called "carbon
leakages". Carbon leakage refers to the possible rise of GHG emissions in countries that do not participate in a carbon
abatement coalition. This paper provides a discussion of the key mechanisms and factors underlying the size of
carbon leakages. To this aim, we use a two-region, two-final goods simplified CGE framework, incorporating three
types of fossil fuels (coal, oil and low-carbon energy), international trade and capital mobility. This framework was
designed to make extensive, multidimensional sensitivity analysis tractable. Indeed, a wide range of alternative
assumptions and parameterisations would have been difficult or even impossible to simulate and interpret with a large
general equilibrium (GE) model. Amongst different determinants of carbon leakages, the results suggest that the
supply elasticity of coal plays a critical role. The degree of product differentiation of manufactured goods and the
international capital mobility appear as relatively less influential. The shape of the production function also matters, a
fact that has attracted little attention so far. Our analysis also suggests that the level of leakage rates is low within the
range of parameters provided in the literature and corresponding to the ones embodied, for example, in the OECD

  abstract    = {Energy is an important commodity in many economic activities. Its usage affects the environment via CO2 emissions and the Greenhouse Effect. Modeling the energy-economy-environment-trade linkages is an important objective in applied economic policy analysis. Previously, however, the modeling of these linkages in GTAP has been incomplete. This is because energy substitution, a key factor in this chain of linkages, is absent from the standard model specification. This technical paper remedies this deficiency by incorporating energy substitution into the standard GTAP model. It begins by first reviewing some of the existing approaches to this problem in contemporary CGE models. It then suggests an approach for GTAP which incorporates some of these desirable features of energy substitution. The approach is implemented as an extended version of the GTAP model called GTAP-E, which includes the standard GTAP model as a special case. In addition, GTAP-E incorporates carbon emissions from the combustion of fossil fuels and this revised version of GTAP-E provides for a mechanism to trade these emissions internationally. The resulting behavior of agents in the model is analyzed using general equilibrium demand elasticities which summarize the combined effect of the new model specification. Implications for policy analysis are demonstrated via a simple simulation experiment in which global carbon emissions are reduced via a carbon tax. Results show that incorporating energy substitution into GTAP is essential for conducting analysis of this problem. The policy relevance of GTAP-E in the context of the existing debate about climate change is illustrated by some simulations of the implementation of the Kyoto Protocol. It is hoped that the proposed model will be used by individuals in the GTAP network who may not be themselves energy modelers, but who require a better representation of the energy-economy linkages than is currently offered in the standard GTAP model.},

  abstract   = {There are few peer-reviewed or major published studies that estimate the total amount of food
 loss in developed countries and even fewer attempt to estimate the monetary value. We compiled estimates
 of the amount and value of food loss for more than 200 individual foods in the United States using the US Department of Agriculture's
 Economic Research Service's Loss-Adjusted Food Availability data and then aggregated these values to estimate the total value of food
 loss and the value by food group. The results indicate that in 2008, the estimated total value of food loss at the retail and consumer
 levels in the United States as purchased at retail prices was \$165.6 billion. The top three food groups in terms of the value of food
 loss at these levels are: meat, poultry, and fish (41\%); vegetables (17\%); and dairy products (14\%). Looking more closely at the estimates
 for the consumer level, this level of loss translates into almost 124 kg (273 lb) of food lost from human consumption, per capita, in 2008
 at an estimated retail price of \$390/capita/year. Food loss represents a significant share of household food expenditures:
 our estimates suggest that the annual value of food loss is almost 10\% of the average amount spent on food per consumer in 2008 and
 over 1\% of the average disposable income. This consumer level loss translates into over .3 kg (0.7 lb) of food per capita per day
 valued at \$1.07/day. Our estimates of the total value of food loss in the United States and loss estimates by food group are useful
 in that they can generate awareness of the issue among the food industry members, governments, and consumers.
 Potential large-scale approaches and economic incentives to mitigate food loss in developed countries are also discussed.},

of challenges to mitigation and challenges to adaptation. The Shared Socioeconomic Pathway 4 (SSP4), "Inequality" or "A Road Divided,"
is one of these scenarios, characterized by low challenges to mitigation and high challenges to adaptation.
We describe, in quantitative terms, the \{SSP4\} as implemented by the Global Change Assessment Model (GCAM), the marker model
for this scenario. We use demographic and economic assumptions, in combination with technology and non-climate policy assumptions to develop
a quantitative representation of energy, land-use and land-cover, and emissions consistent with the \{SSP4\}
narrative. The scenario is one with stark differences within and across regions. High-income regions prosper, continuing
to increase their demand for energy and food. Electrification increases in these regions, with the increased
generation being met by nuclear and renewables. Low-income regions, however, stagnate due to limited economic growth. Growth
in total consumption is dominated by increases in population, not increases in per capita consumption. Due
to failures in energy access policies, these regions continue to depend on traditional biofuels, leading to high
pollutant emissions. Declining dependence on fossil fuels in all regions means that total radiative forcing absent the inclusion of mitigation
or impacts only reaches 6.4 W $\textrm{m}^2$ in 2100, making this a world with relatively low challenges to mitigation.
We explore the effects of mitigation effort on the \{SSP4\} world, finding that the imposition of a carbon price has a
varied effect across regions. In particular, the \{SSP4\} mitigation scenarios are characterized by afforestation in the high-income
regions and deforestation in the low-income regions. Furthermore, we find that the \{SSP4\} is a world with low challenges to
mitigation, but only to a point due to incomplete mitigation of land-related emissions.},

Based on the new version of the GTAP-W model we analyze the effect of potential water savings
and the welfare implications of improvements in irrigation efficiency worldwide. The results show that a water
policy directed to improve irrigation efficiency led to global and regional water savings, but it is
not beneficial for all regions. The final effect on regional welfare will depend on the interaction
of several different causes. For instance, higher irrigation efficiency changes opportunity costs and reverses
comparative advantages, modifying regional trade patterns and welfare. For water-stressed
regions the effects on welfare are mostly positive. For nonwater scarce regions the results
are more mixed and mostly negative.
The results show that exports of virtual water are not exclusive of water abundant regions.},

  year       = {2012},
  abstract   = {Future projections of the impact of international climate change (and other) policies are usually presented
 against a \"business as usual\" baseline or a reference scenario. As a wide range of possible factors can
 affect the economic growth projections, it is useful to depict a range of possible developments. This paper
 presents a set of global representative scenarios that may provide alternative perspectives on future socioeconomic
 developments and compare these scenarios in terms of their respective economic and
 environmental consequences. The scenarios are based on the {Shared Socioeconomic Pathways} ({SSP})
 storylines developed by the {Integrated Assessment Modelling Consortium} ({O'Neill} et al., 2012). The
 different scenarios (i.e. {SSP} representations) are then framed in terms of how they affect different elements
 that influence growth, such as demographics, education and technology convergence. Given the long-term
 nature of some of the major environmental challenges, including climate change, the time horizon is 2100.
 This paper typically assumes a convergence process, though placing special emphasis on the drivers of
 {GDP} growth over the projection period rather than projecting convergence only on income levels. Based
 on this, long-term projections are made for key drivers of per capita economic growth (e.g. total factor
 productivity and human capital). Together with population growth, these drivers are then used to project
 {GDP} pathways for more than 175 countries, representing 98.5\% of global {GDP} in 2010.},

affected the country's total domestic value added (DVA) and employment in the years 2002 and
2007. For every US$1000 dollar of Chinese exports in 2007 (2002),
\{DVA\} and employment are estimated to be US\$591 (US\$466) and 0.096 (0.242) person-year, respectively.
To implement these estimations, we use hitherto unpublished Chinese government data
to construct several completely new datasets, including an input-output table with
separate input-output and employment-output coefficients for processing exports, non-processing exports,
and output for domestic use. We hypothesize that, in comparison with the export sector,
China's domestic sector would be relatively autarkic due to China's history of central planning.
We expect that exports would generate less \{DVA\} and employment than output for domestic use.
Processing exports, which are highly dependent on imported inputs, would similarly generate less \{DVA\}
and employment than non-processing exports. Our findings support these expectations.
For both 2002 and 2007, the \{DVA\} and employment effects of domestic final demand were
higher than those of non-processing exports, which were in turn higher than those of processing exports.
However, with the progress of economic reforms, we found that the total \{DVAs\} of
exports and domestic final demand have converged from 2002 to 2007.},

Calibration contrasts with estimation in relying on deterministic calculation of model parameter values consistent with data, rather than econometric estimation. The reasons why calibrators use these methods, as well as the main arguments in debates between calibrators and econometricians are set out. We draw a distinction between the calibration methods used in dynamic macro models of the Kydland-Prescott type and micro models of the Shoven-Whalley variety. We highlight the ways in which calibration techniques are evolving including double calibration, the use of data pre-adjustments, and the incorporation of model estimation consistent elasticities. We conclude with a discussion of what constitutes best practice in calibration.},

The main focus is on changing consumption patterns and the consequences for food security and for the pressure on natural resources. In this context, the question is raised as to how foresight work can reflect the mechanisms by which a transition towards more sustainable consumption can influence the sustainability of the production systems. The authors first analyze the main drivers of the past and future evolution of food systems and then the implications for foresight analysis. An attempt is made to identify specific issues and policies that should be further analyzed. In particular, future foresight will be challenged to incorporate the interactions between consumption and production more explicitly and to address four issues: (i) intra-national heterogeneity of diets and resulting nutritional outcomes, (ii) externalities resulting from the process of production, processing, and marketing along the product chain, (iii) competition between food and non-food uses of agricultural commodities and between agricultural and non-agricultural use of land and (iv) mechanisms by which food scarcity causes hunger and malnutrition.},

  abstract = {Abstract Long-term economic scenarios (up to 2100) are needed as a basis to explore possible different futures for major environmental challenges,
including climate change. Given the high level of uncertainty involved, such scenarios would need to span a wide range of possible growth trajectories.
The recently developed storylines of the Shared Socioeconomic Pathways (SSPs) provide a basis for making such projections. This paper describes a
consistent methodology to derive (per capita) {GDP} trend pathways on a country basis. The methodology is based on a convergence process and
places emphasis on the key drivers of economic growth in the long run: population, total factor productivity, physical capital, employment and human capital,
and energy and fossil fuel resources (specifically oil and gas). The paper uses this methodology to derive country-level economic growth projections
for 184 countries. The paper also investigates the influence of short-term growth rate estimates on the long-term income levels in various countries.
It does so by comparing long-term projections based on short-term forecasts from 2011 with the projections based on forecasts from 2013.
This highlights the effects of the recent economic crisis and uncertainty in short term developments on longer term growth trends.
The projections are subject to large uncertainties, particularly for the later decades, and disregard a wide range of country-specific
drivers of economic growth that are outside the narrow economic framework, such as external shocks, governance barriers and feedbacks
from environmental damage. Hence, they should be interpreted with sufficient care and not be treated as predictions.},

Keeping the eastern countries out seriously endangers their economic transition, and economic failure in the east could threaten peace and prosperity in western Europe. The perceived economic costs and benefits will dictate the enlargement's timing. There are four parts to the calculus -- the costs and the benefits in the east and in the west. Here we break new ground in estimating the economic benefits of enlargement for east and west using simulations in a global applied general equilibrium model. Our analysis includes a scenario in which joining the EU significantly reduces the risk premium on investment in the east -- with resulting huge benefits to the new entrants. We also review the existing literature on the EU budget costs and arrive at a surprisingly well-determined 'consensus' estimate, which we support with a new political economy analysis of the budget. The bottom line is unambiguous and strongly positive: enlargement is a very good deal for both the EU incumbents and the new members.},

Since the model�s first projections were published in 2003, substantial improvements have been made to the model, and improved estimates of the probability distributions of uncertain input parameters have become available. The new projections are considerably warmer than the 2003 projections; for example, the median surface warming in 2091�2100 is 5.1�C compared to 2.4�C in the earlier study. Many changes contribute to the stronger warming; among the more important ones are taking into account the cooling in the second half of the twentieth century due to volcanic eruptions for input parameter estimation and a more sophisticated method for projecting gross domestic product (GDP) growth, which eliminated many low-emission scenarios. However, if recently published data, suggesting stronger twentieth-century ocean warming, are used to determine the input climate parameters, the median projected warming at the end of the twenty-first century is only 4.1�C. Nevertheless, all ensembles of the simulations discussed here produce a much smaller probability of warming less than 2.4�C than implied by the lower bound of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) Fourth Assessment Report (AR4) projected likely range for the A1FI scenario, which has forcing very similar to the median projection in this study. The probability distribution for the surface warming produced by this analysis is more symmetric than the distribution assumed by the IPCC because of a different feedback between the climate and the carbon cycle, resulting from the inclusion in this model of the carbon�nitrogen interaction in the terrestrial ecosystem.},

However, up to now, agricultural sector models and models on land use change have used technological change
as an exogenous input due to various information and data deficiencies. This paper provides a first attempt towards an
endogenous implementation based on a measure of agricultural land use intensity. We relate this measure
to empirical data on investments in technological change. Our estimated yield elasticity with respect to research investments is
0.29 and production costs per area increase linearly with an increasing yield level. Implemented in the global land use
model MAgPIE ("Model of Agricultural Production and its Impact on the Environment") this approach provides estimates of future yield growth.

Highest future yield increases are required in Sub-Saharan Africa, the Middle East and South Asia.
Our validation with FAO data for the period 1995--2005 indicates that the model behavior is in line with observations.
By comparing two scenarios on forest conservation we show that protecting sensitive forest areas in the future
is possible but requires substantial investments into technological change.},

 take more strongly into account three essential elements of the climate
 problem--the endogeneity of growth, the convexity of damages, and climate
 risk--optimal policy comprises strong controls. To focus on these

the \{CO2\} content of China's exports are significantly biased because production fragmentation has not

are able to distinguish processing exports from normal exports. Our results show that China's
emissions as embodied in its exports are overestimated by more than 60% if the distinction
between processing exports and normal exports is not made. Another finding is that
each Yuan of value added generated by processing exports leads to 34% less \{CO2\} emissions

The Armington specification of trade, assuming country-level product differentiation, has been central to CGE modelling for 40 years. Starting in the 1980s with Krugman and more recently Melitz, trade theorists have preferred specifications with firm-level product differentiation. We draw out the connections between the Armington, Krugman and Melitz models, deriving them as successively less restrictive special cases of an encompassing model. We then investigate optimality properties of the Melitz model, demonstrating that a Melitz general equilibrium is the solution to a global, cost-minimizing problem. This suggests that envelope theorems can be used in interpreting results from a Melitz model. Next we explain the Balistreri-Rutherford decomposition in which a Melitz general equilibrium model is broken into Melitz sectoral models combined with an Armington general equilibrium model. Balistreri and Rutherford see their decomposition as a basis of an iterative approach for solving Melitz general equilibrium models. We see it as a means for interpreting Melitz results as the outcome of an Armington simulation with additional shocks to productivity and preferences variables. With CGE modelers in mind, we report computational experience in solving a Melitz general equilibrium model using GEMPACK.},

  abstract  = {{MONASH} is a dynamic general equilibrium model of the Australian economy. This article describes a new
 labour-market specification for {MONASH} in which people are allocated in year t to categories according to their labourmarket
 activities in year t--1. People in each category plan their labour supplies by solving an optimisation problem. Via these problems,
 we introduce the assumption that people in employment categories supply labour more strongly to employment activities than do people in
 unemployment categories. Thus we find that employment-stimulating policies in t--1 increase labour supply in t by shifting the composition of
 the labour force in t in favour of employment categories and away from unemployment categories. We illustrate this idea by using {MONASH}
 to simulate the Dawkins proposal to combine a freeze on award wage rates with tax credits for low-wage workers in low-income families. We find that the Dawkins
 policy would generate a significant short-run increase in employment. With the increase in employment generating an increase in
 labour supply, the employment benefits of the policy would persist over many years. However, in the long run, we would expect the effect
 of the policy on aggregate employment to be small and to depend on how the policy affected the ratio of real after-tax wage rates to unemployment benefits.},

 projections are found to be sensitive to future economic policies in the areas of education, pensions, labour markets and
 climate change mitigation, and even more so to total factor productivity and population trends. A baseline scenario projects
 fairly stable world {GDP} growth of about 3.5\% annually on average (in {PPP} terms) over 2005–2050.},

serviceable. But recent interest in reducing fossil fuel carbon emissions have focused on the development of
renewable energy technologies. One of the more promising technologies is biomass energy. But to provide large
scale contributions to the energy system requires that biomass energy become part of the modem agricultural sector.
This has potential implications for other agricultural production and for rates of land-use change emissions. In this
paper we explore some of the interactions between commercial biomass energy production, land-use change
emissions, and total anthropogenic carbon emissions. We find that the introduction of commercial biomass energy
tends to accelerate the rate of intrusion into unmanaged ecosystems, and to accelerate land-use change emissions,
but that the overall effect on total anthropogenic carbon emissions to reduce them.},

 from other countries. Scenarios of increased crop productivity and water use, cropland expansion (excluding areas prioritized
 for other uses) and population change are accounted for. We found that currently 16\% of the world population use the opportunities
 of international trade to cover their demand for agricultural products. Population change may strongly increase the number of
 people depending on ex situ land and water resources up to about 5.2 billion (51\% of world population) in the SRES A2r scenario.
 International trade will thus have to intensify if population growth is not accompanied by dietary change towards less
 resource-intensive products, by cropland expansion, or by productivity improvements, mainly in Africa and the Middle East.
 Up to 1.3 billion people may be at risk of food insecurity in 2050 in present low-income economies (mainly in Africa),
 if their economic development does not allow them to afford productivity increases, cropland expansion and/or imports from other
 countries.},

complements to regulation of domestic greenhouse gas emissions. We consider four policies that could be

charge on imports, a border rebate for exports, full border adjustment, and domestic output-based rebating.
Each option faces different potential legal hurdles in international trade law; each also has different
-conomic impacts. While all can support competitiveness, none is necessarily effective at reducing global emissions.
Nor is it possible to rank the options; effectiveness depends on the relative emissions rates,
elasticities of substitution, and consumption volumes. We illustrate these results with simulations
for the energy-intensive sectors of three different economies---the United States, Canada, and Europe.
Although most controversial, full border adjustment is usually most effective, but output-based rebating
for key manufacturing sectors can achieve many of the gains.},

 agriculture's environmental footprint must shrink dramatically. Here we analyse solutions to this dilemma,
 showing that tremendous progress could be made by halting agricultural expansion, closing 'yield gaps'

 Together, these strategies could double food production while greatly reducing the environmental impacts of agriculture.},

  abstract = {The Paris Agreement has opened debate on whether limiting warming to 1.5~\textdegree{}C is compatible with current emission pledges and warming of
about 0.9~\textdegree{}C from the mid-nineteenth century to the present decade. We show that limiting cumulative post-2015 $\textrm{CO}_2$ emissions to
about 200\,GtC would limit post-2015 warming to less than 0.6~\textdegree{}C in 66\% of Earth system model members of the CMIP5 ensemble with
no mitigation of other climate drivers, increasing to 240\,GtC with ambitious non-$\textrm{CO}_2$ mitigation. We combine a simple climate-carbon-cycle
model with estimated ranges for key climate system properties from the IPCC Fifth Assessment Report. Assuming emissions peak
and decline to below current levels by 2030, and continue thereafter on a much steeper decline, which would be historically
unprecedented but consistent with a standard ambitious mitigation scenario (RCP2.6), results in a likely range of peak warming of 1.2-2.0$\,^{\circ}$C above the mid-nineteenth century.
If $\textrm{CO}_2$ emissions are continuously adjusted over time to limit 2100 warming to $1.5\,^{\circ}$C, with ambitious non-$\textrm{CO}_2$ mitigation,
net future cumulative $\textrm{CO}_2$ emissions are unlikely to prove less than 250\,GtC and unlikely greater than 540\,GtC.
Hence, limiting warming to 1.5~\textdegree{}C is not yet a geophysical impossibility, but is likely to require delivery
on strengthened pledges for 2030 followed by challengingly deep and rapid mitigation. Strengthening near-term emissions reductions
would hedge against a high climate response or subsequent reduction rates proving economically, technically or politically unfeasible.},

 the energy constraint through dynamic modelling of energy productivity, and departing from the assumptions of either a closed economy
 or full capital mobility by applying a Feldstein-Horioka-type relationship between savings and investment rates.
 Our results suggest that, accounting for relative price variations, China could account for 33\% of the world economy in 2050,
 which would be much more than the United States (9\%), India (8\%), the European Union (12\%) and Japan (5\%).
 They suggest also that China would overtake the United States around 2020 (2040 at constant relative prices).
 However, in terms of standards of living, measured through {GDP} per capita in purchasing power parity,
 China would still lag 10 percent behind the United States at the 2050 horizon.},

  abstract    = {This study provides insights into the nature and magnitude of the impacts of the WTO Doha Round for international trade and the resulting welfare improvements. We use a global computable general equilibrium model. The most important aspects of the model can be summarized as follows: (i) it covers all world trade and production; (ii) it allows for scale economies and imperfect competition; (iii) it includes intermediate linkages between sectors; (iv) and it allows for trade to affect capital stocks through investment effects. The last point means that we model medium to long-run investment effects. The inclusion of scale economies and imperfect competition implies agglomeration effects like those emphasized in the recent economic geography literature. The model uses GTAP (version 5) data.
Considerable attention was given in the study to the development of a realistic "baseline". This baseline already takes into account events such as the entry of China into the WTO, the Agenda 2000 reform of the EU’s Common Agricultural Policy (CAP) and the addition of new members to the EU. In this way it is possible to estimate those effects that are specifically attributable only to further trade liberalisation in the Doha Round.
Non-quantitative trade restrictions, such as those facing the services sector, are usually not included in quantitative analyses. This carries the risk of underestimating the importance of these less visible trade restrictions. For this reason, this study attempts to quantify the effects of both liberalising trade in services and reducing administrative barriers facing exporters and importers at border-crossings.
A review of the international tariff situation reveals that the specific modalities of tariff reductions are at least as important as the actual amount reduced. Reduction modalities that target peak tariffs result in a different tariff landscape compared to more simple reductions in average tariffs. Furthermore, developing countries have a particular interest in reducing tariffs that currently hamper South-South trade. This results from the fact that many developing countries have secured a high level of protection under the Uruguay Round.
The increase in global income from trade liberalisation is estimated at between $200 billion in the middle term to $650 billion in the long run, taking into account the effects of trade-stimulated investment. The analysis underlines the importance of trade policy reform by developing countries for achieving these benefits. About one quarter of the global gains can only be realized if developing countries actively participate. At the same time, developing countries can achieve high gains relative to their current income levels.
A third of the estimated benefit of $220 to $600 billion is attributable to trade facilitation, a third to agricultural liberalisation and the remaining third approximately equally to both reductions in industrial tariffs and liberalisation in services. Leaving aside trade facilitation and services liberalisation, industrialised countries have the most interest in seeing agricultural liberalisation in other OECD economies as well as a reduction in industrial tariffs by developing countries. For developing countries, the benefits arise primarily from trade liberalisation with other developing countries.
The results for the agricultural sector are mixed: net benefits at a global level, with particularly the EU, Africa and the majority of Asia profitting, but potentially negative effects in the long-term for the Asia-Pacific region and North America . This is a striking results that seems at odds with the current positions taken in the agricultural negotiations. However, the results highlight the importance of taking a long-term structural view. CAIRNS group countries should perhaps be cautious about expecting long-term economy-wide gains if, as a result of liberalization, the agricultural sector draws more resources away from other productive uses. Developing countries also need to think carefully about the risks of reinforcing an emphasis on primary exports.
The potential increase in world income from reducing agricultural import tariffs alone could reach $60 billion, but 60 percent of this is dependent on effective dismantling of market protection in developing countries. Additional reduction of internal agricultural support results in an economy-wide increase in income that is greater for the EU than for North America. Within Europe this is more relevant for France, Germany and Eastern Europe than for the Netherlands. Dutch agriculture, with its own particular specialisations, is less dependent on European production support than the typical agricultural sectors of other countries.
The worldwide results are consistently positive for the industrial sector, with regards to both short- and long-run effects. The benefits of reducing industrial tariffs, estimated at about $35 billion with partial liberalisation, and $55 billion with full liberalisation, are (especially in the long term) greater than those for the agricultural sector due to the relatively larger investment spending released in the industrial sector. The readyness of developing countries to reduce effectively their own tariffs is crucial to realising the worldwide benefits in this area. Many of these countries have hardly reduced their tariffs at all from their relatively high levels. This limits the bargaining power of developing countries and means that the debate as to which tariffs (bound or applied) to use as the reference point is particularly important. A noteworthy exception could be China as it meets stiffer competition from other developing countries and finds its export prices under pressure. These results highlight the critical role that determination of market access modalities (including benchmark or base negotiating rates) will play in securing benefits for developing countries.},

a consistent set of assumptions. The recently developed Shared Socioeconomic Pathways (SSPs) create a
framework for the study of climate-related scenario outcomes. Their five narratives span a wide range of worlds
that vary in their challenges for climate change mitigation and adaptation. Here we provide background on the
quantification that has been selected to serve as the reference, or 'marker', implementation for SSP2. The \{SSP2\} narrative
describes a middle-of-the-road development in the mitigation and adaptation challenges space. We explain how the
narrative has been translated into quantitative assumptions in the \{IIASA\} Integrated Assessment Modelling Framework.
We show that our \{SSP2\} marker implementation occupies a central position for key metrics along the
mitigation and adaptation challenge dimensions. For many dimensions the \{SSP2\} marker implementation also
reflects an extension of the historical experience, particularly in terms of carbon and energy intensity improvements in
its baseline. This leads to a steady emissions increase over the 21st century, with projected end-of-century warming nearing 4~{\textdegree}C
relative to preindustrial levels. On the other hand, \{SSP2\} also shows that global-mean temperature increase can be limited to below 2~{\textdegree}C,
pending stringent climate policies throughout the world. The added value of the \{SSP2\} marker implementation for
the wider scientific community is that it can serve as a starting point to further explore integrated solutions for achieving
multiple societal objectives in light of the climate adaptation and mitigation challenges that society could face over the 21st century.},

 agricultural productivity growth has improved in some countries. Enhanced productivity is correlated with investments
 in agricultural research, wider adoption of new technologies, and policy reforms that have strengthened economic incentives to farmers.
 Many of the technological improvements have come from the Consultative Group for International Agricultural Research (CGIAR) centers.
 Benefits from the CGIAR in SSA are estimated to be over {\$6} for each {\$1} invested. Returns to national agricultural research
 are also robust, at least for large countries. But overall investment in agricultural research has remained low, and increases in
 research capacity will likely be necessary to significantly accelerate agricultural growth in the region.
 Other constraints to agricultural productivity include government policies that reduce earnings in the farm sector,
 the spread of the HIV/AIDS virus, and armed conflict within and between countries.},

which is supposed to face high challenges both in mitigation and adaptation. The \{AIM\} model has been selected as the
model to quantify the \{SSP3\} marker scenario, a representative case illustrating a particular narrative. Multiple
parameter assumptions in AIM/CGE were differentiated across the \{SSPs\} for quantification. We confirm that \{SSP3\}
quantitative scenarios outcomes are consistent with its narrative. Moreover, four key features of \{SSP3\} are
observed. First, as \{SSP3\} was originally designed to contain a high level of challenges to mitigation,
mitigation costs in \{SSP3\} were relatively high. This results from the combination of high greenhouse gas emissions
in the baseline (no climate mitigation policy) scenario and low mitigative capacity. Second, the climate forcing level
in 2100 for the baseline scenarios of \{SSP3\} was similar to that of SSP2, whereas \{CO2\} emissions in \{SSP3\} are
higher than those in SSP2. This is mainly due to high aerosol emissions in SSP3. A third feature was the high air
pollutant emissions associated with weak implementation of air quality legislation and a high level of coal
dependency. Fourth, forest area steadily decreases with a large expansion of cropland and pasture land. T
hese characteristics indicate at least four potential uses for SSP3. First, \{SSP3\} is useful for
both \{IAM\} and impact, adaptation, vulnerability (IAV) analyses to present the worst-case scenario. Second, by
comparing \{SSP2\} and SSP3, \{IAV\} analyses can clarify the influences of socioeconomic elements under
similar climatic conditions. Third, the high air pollutant emissions would be of interest to atmospheric chemistry climate modelers.
Finally, in addition to climate change studies, many other environmental studies could benefit from the meaningful
insights available from the large-scale land use change resulting in SSP3.},

 gas abatement; however, the resulting impacts on agricultural production, producer livelihoods, and
 food security remain largely unexplored. This paper provides an integrated assessment of the linkages between land-based climate
 policies, development, and food security, with a particular emphasis on abatement opportunities and impacts in the
 livestock sector. Targeting {Annex I} countries and exempting {non-Annex I} countries from land-based carbon policies on
 equity or food security grounds may result in significant leakage rates for livestock production and agriculture as a whole.
 We find that such leakage can be eliminated by supplying forest carbon sequestration incentives to non-Annex I countries.
 Furthermore, substantial additional global agricultural abatement can be attained by extending a greenhouse
 gas emissions tax to non-Annex I agricultural producers, while compensating them for their additional tax expenses.
 Because of their relatively large emissions intensities and limited abatement possibilities, ruminant meat producers face
 the greatest market adjustments to land-based climate policies. We also evaluate the impacts of climate policies on livelihoods
 and food consumption in developing countries. In the absence of non-Annex I abatement policies, these impacts are modest.
 However, strong income and food consumption impacts surface because of higher food costs after forest carbon sequestration is
 promoted at a global scale. Food consumption among unskilled labor households falls but rises for the representative farm households,
 because global agricultural supplies are restricted and farm prices rise sharply in the face of inelastic food demands.},

 by land-based activities in agriculture and forestry. Land-based activities are responsible for over a third of global
 greenhouse gas emissions, yet the economics of land-use decisions have not been explicitly modeled in global mitigation studies.
 In this paper, we develop a new, general equilibrium framework which effectively captures the opportunity costs of
 land-use decisions in agriculture and forestry, thereby allowing us to analyse competition for heterogeneous land
 types across and within sectors, as well as input substitution between land and other factors of production.
 When land-using sectors are confronted with a tax on greenhouse gas emissions, we find significant changes in the global pattern of
 comparative advantage across sectors, regions, and land types. Globally, we find that forest carbon sequestration is the
 dominant strategy for {GHG} emissions mitigation, while agricultural-related mitigation comes predominantly from reduced methane emissions in the ruminant
 livestock sector, followed by fertilizer and methane emissions from paddy rice. Regionally, agricultural mitigation
 is a larger share of total land-use emissions abatement in the {USA} and China, compared to the rest of the world, and, within
 agriculture, disproportionately from reductions in fertilizer-related emissions. The results also show how analyses that
 only consider regional mitigation, may bias mitigation potential by ignoring global market interactions. For example,
 USA-specific analyses likely over-estimate the potential for abatement in agriculture. Finally, we note that this general equilibrium
 framework provides the research community with a practical methodology for explicit modeling of global land competition and
 land-based mitigation in comprehensive assessments of greenhouse gas mitigation options."},

the distance to the WECG, which is highly correlated with the remoteness

municipal solid waste where it accounts for almost 25 percent of U.S. methane emissions. Reducing food losses
by just 15 percent would be enough food to feed more than 25 million Americans every year at a time when one
in six Americans lack a secure supply of food to their tables. Increasing the efficiency of our food system is a
triple-bottom-line solution that requires collaborative efforts by businesses, governments and consumers. The U.S.
government should conduct a comprehensive study of losses in our food system and set national goals for waste
reduction; businesses should seize opportunities to streamline their own operations, reduce food losses and save
money; and consumers can waste less food by shopping wisely, knowing when food goes bad, buying produce that
is perfectly edible even if it's less cosmetically attractive, cooking only the amount of food they need, and eating
their leftovers.},

However, most economic models ignore water as an essential factor of production. In contrast with other inputs,
economic data do not reflect the role of water in the production processes of goods and services and its final value in
the demand side. This makes it difficult to incorporate water in economic models, properly examine its role in economic activities,
and study its interaction with other inputs in the production processes. Introducing water into an economy-wide database such as Global
Trade Analysis Project (GTAP) Data Base which has been widely used by many economic modelers across the world could
help them to extend their research agendas on the role and importance of water in economic
activities. As the first step towards this direction we divided the crop sectors of the GTAP-Power Data Base
(which extends the GTAP Data Base Version 9 by disaggregating the electricity sector) into irrigated and rainfed
categories and explicitly included water for irrigation into the cost structure of irrigated crops
by river basin at the Agro Ecological Zone (AEZ) level.},

  abstract   = {GEMPACK is a suite of general-purpose economic modelling software especially suitable
 for general and partial equilibrium models. It can handle a wide range of economic behaviour
 and also contains a versatile method for solving intertemporal models. GEMPACK provides software
 for calculating accurate solutions of an economic model, starting from an algebraic representation
 of the equations of the model. These equations can be written as levels equations, linearized equations
 or a mixture of these two. The software provides a range of utility programs for handling the economic
 data base and the results of simulations, and is fully documented from a user's point of view.
 GEMPACK is used to implement and solve a number of economic models including several single-country
 models (of which the ORANI model of Australia is perhaps the best known), multi-country trade models,
 regional models and intertemporal (or dynamic) models. GEMPACK runs on a wide variety of computers including 80386/80486
 microcomputers running DOS, Windows or OS/2, Apple Macintosh computers, Unix machines, DEC VAX and Alpha machines
 running VMS. This paper gives an overview of the current release of GEMPACK (Release 5.1, April 1994).
 Included are descriptions of * the algebra-like language used to describe and document the equations of an economic model,
 * the operation of the pre-processor TABLO which converts the equations of the model to a form suitable
 for computing solutions of the model, * the solution methods used for producing accurate solutions of the model,
 * the facilities for specifying and carrying out simulations, including the options for varying
 the choice of endogenous and exogenous variables and the variables shocked, * the condensation facility
 which makes it possible to solve very large models, * the utility programs for assisting in managing the data bases
 on which models are based, * the different versions of GEMPACK.<P>(This abstract was borrowed from another version of this item},

increases due to expanding biofuel acreage. We use \{GLOBIOM\}---an economic partial equilibrium model of the global forest, agriculture, and
biomass sectors with a bottom-up representation of agricultural and forestry management practices.
The results indicate that second generation biofuel production fed by wood from sustainably managed
existing forests would lead to a negative iLUC factor, meaning that overall emissions are 27\% lower
compared to the "No biofuel" scenario by 2030. The iLUC factor of first generation biofuels global expansion is generally
positive, requiring some 25 years to be paid back by the \{GHG\} savings from
the substitution of biofuels for conventional fuels. Second generation biofuels perform better also
with respect to the other investigated criteria; on the condition that they are not sourced from
dedicated plantations directly competing for agricultural land. If so, then efficient first generation systems are preferable.
Since no clear technology champion for all situations exists, we would recommend targeting policy instruments directly at
the positive and negative effects of biofuel production rather than at the production itself.},

<b>Changes from v.4.1 to v.5.0</b>

<ol><li>Module Structure

The organization of the GTAP.TAB file was changed with version 5.0 to introduce a modular structure. This reorganization aims to facilitate an improved understanding of the structure of GTAP model as well as to make it easier to modify the model. Each module is a collection of coefficients, variables, formulae and equations, grouped by economic functions. For example, the Government Consumption Module is a group of coefficients, variables, formulae and equations associated with government demands for goods and services. Further the module breaks down into two sub-modules corresponding to the nested CES structure of government consumption. One of the sub-modules represents government consumption demands for domestic and imported goods (the bottom of the nest), and the other for the composite demands (the top of the nest). Organizing related bits and pieces in this way offers intuitive comprehension of GTAP model structure. It results in eight main modules representing the essential building blocks of the GTAP model. The modular structure also facilitates modification and revision of the GTAP model. All modules are knitted together by thread of common coefficients or variables, which are defined as shared across modules. If one of the common (shared) variable's name is changed, for a simple example, all the modules containing the variables will be affected by this change and must be modified accordingly. If a new name is assigned to the variable only used in one module, this change only affects the module locally, so there is no need to worry about other modules. This may sound obvious but organizing the model file in this way provides an important practical tool for those trying to alter the model by indicating clearly whether the change she is making is only local to a module or global to other modules.</li>


<li>Multiple Margins Sectors

The GTAP database has historically treated the international freight and insurance margin as a single service, supplied by national trade and transport sectors, and provided by a mythical global transport sector. The version 5 GTAP database has disaggregated transport into three modes: sea, air, land. This increased attention to international transport costs comes at an opportune time, as increased attention is focused on the role of these costs in international trade (see, for example, Hummels (2000)). It will also support improved analysis of liberalization of services under the WTO's General Agreement on Trade in Services (GATS). In order to accommodate this change in data structure, the model had to be revised.</li>


<li>Correction on "ao" when ESUBT > 0

When the GTAP model was generalized to permit a non-zero substitution elasticity between intermediates and value-added (ESUBT > 0), the technology shock at the top level of the production function was not properly generalized. The derivation of the proper equation is provided in Gohin and Hertel (2000). The version 5.0 GTAP.TAB file implemented this correction.</li></ol>},

  abstract = {Abstract In many poor countries, the recent increases in prices of staple foods have raised the real incomes of those selling food, many of whom are relatively poor, while hurting net food consumers, many of whom are also relatively poor. The impacts on poverty will certainly be very diverse, but the average impact on poverty depends upon the balance between these two effects, and can only be determined by looking at real-world data. Results using household data for 10 observations on nine low-income countries show that the short-run impacts of higher staple food prices on poverty differ considerably by commodity and by country, but that poverty increases are much more frequent, and larger, than poverty reductions. The recent large increases in food prices appear likely to raise overall poverty in low-income countries substantially.},

used in these exercises. We then introduce an analytical partial equilibrium model of the global crops sector, which provides a
lens through which we can evaluate this previous work. The resulting decomposition of model responses into demand, extensive supply, and intensive
supply elasticities offers important insights into the diversity of model parameterizations being employed by the existing models.
Along with the methodology for implementing productivity growth, this helps explain some of the divergences in results.
We employ a numerical version of the analytical model, which serves as an emulator of this entire class of models,
to explore how uncertainties in the common underlying drivers and economic responses contribute to uncertain projections
of output, prices, and land use in 2050. We place each of the published estimates reviewed here into the resulting empirical
distribution of outcomes at mid-century. In addition, we quantify the sensitivity of these projections to model inputs. Our
findings suggest that the top priority for future research should be improved estimation of agricultural factor
supply elasticities, a topic that has been largely neglected in recent decades.},

  abstract = {There has been a resurgence of interest in the impacts of agricultural productivity
 on land use and the environment. At the center of this debate is the assertion that agricultural innovation is land
 sparing. However, numerous case studies and global empirical studies have found little evidence of higher yields being
 accompanied by reduced area. We find that these studies overlook two crucial factors: estimation of a true counterfactual
 scenario and a tendency to adopt a regional, rather than a global, perspective. This paper introduces a general framework
 for analyzing the impacts of regional and global innovation on long run crop output, prices, land rents, land use, and
 associated CO2 emissions. In so doing, it facilitates a reconciliation of the apparently conflicting views of the impacts
 of agricultural productivity growth on global land use and environmental quality. Our historical analysis demonstrates
 that the Green Revolution in Asia, Latin America, and the Middle East was unambiguously land and emissions sparing,
 compared with a counterfactual world without these innovations. In contrast, we find that the environmental
 impacts of a prospective African Green Revolution are potentially ambiguous. We trace these divergent outcomes to
 relative differences between the innovating region and the rest of the world in yields, emissions efficiencies,
 cropland supply response, and intensification potential. Globalization of agriculture raises the potential for
 adverse environmental consequences. However, if sustained for several decades, an African Green Revolution will
 eventually become land sparing.},

In particular, this money metric change is broken down into component parts, each of which relates to a quantity change interacting with a distortion in the model. This enables the user to assess, for example, how much of the gains from trade reform are attributable to a given commodity and/or a given region. The commodity and region specific changes in allocative efficiency can be further decomposed by transaction/tax instrument. We find that this greatly facilitates the presentation and analysis of results from GTAP.

We motivate the derivation of this decomposition with the case of a one region, three commodity, analogue to the GTAP model. This permits us to focus on purely allocative efficiency effects (no terms of the trade changes). Extension to the multiregion model adds the prospect of terms of trade effects on regional EV, and the multiregion decomposition isolates the contribution of tradable price changes to regional welfare. This is demonstrated in a 3 region, 3 commodity example. Finally, we offer a more complete decomposition which takes into account the impact of changes in endowments and technology on regional welfare.

This revised (2001) version introduces a number of important changes to the original (1996) paper. In particular, we build on the new final demand structure for GTAP proposed by McDougall (2001). This includes explicit recognition of changes in the marginal utility of income, as well as a per capita decomposition. We also take account of version 5.0 changes in the standard GTAP model, including the introduction of multiple international margins commodities.},

  abstract = {Mitigation of the potential impacts of climate change is one of the leading policy concerns of the 21st century.
However, there continues to be heated debate about the nature, the content and, most importantly, the impact of
the policy actions needed to limit greenhouse gas emissions. One contributing factor is the lack of systematic evidence on the
impact of mitigation policy on the welfare of the poor in developing countries. In this letter we consider two alternative policy scenarios,
one in which only the Annex I countries take action, and the second in which the first policy is accompanied by a forest carbon sequestration policy in
the non-Annex regions. Using an economic climate policy analysis framework, we assess the poverty impacts of the
above policy scenarios on seven socio-economic groups in 14 developing countries. We find that the Annex-I-only policy is
poverty friendly, since it enhances the competitiveness of non-Annex countries---particularly in agricultural production. However, once
forest carbon sequestration incentives in the non-Annex regions are added to the policy package, the overall effect is to raise poverty
in the majority of our sample countries. The reason for this outcome is that the dominant impacts
of this policy are to raise returns to land, reduce agricultural output and raise food prices. Since poor households rely primarily on their own labor for income,
and generally own little land, and since they also spend a large share of their income on food, they are generally hurt
on both the earning and the spending fronts. This result is troubling, since forest carbon sequestration---particularly through avoided
deforestation---is a promising, low cost option for climate change mitigation.},

 way of investigating the impact of (fat-tailed) uncertainty on optimal climate policy:
 the curvature of the optimal carbon tax against the uncertainty. We find that the
 optimal carbon tax increases as the uncertainty about climate sensitivity increases,
 but it does not accelerate as implied by Weitzman's Dismal Theorem. We find
 the same result in a wide variety of sensitivity analyses. These results emphasize
 the importance of balancing the costs of climate change against its benefits,

describing alternative societal development trends over the coming decades. Urbanization is a key aspect of development that is
relevant to studies of mitigation, adaptation, and impacts. Incorporating urbanization into the \{SSPs\} requires a
consistent set of global urbanization projections that cover long time horizons and span a full range of uncertainty.
Existing urbanization projections do not meet these needs, in particular providing only a single scenario over the next
few decades, a period during which urbanization is likely to be highly dynamic in many countries. We present here a new,
long-term, global set of urbanization projections at country level that cover a plausible range of uncertainty.
We create SSP-specific projections by choosing urbanization outcomes consistent with each \{SSP\} narrative. Results show
that the world continues to urbanize in each of the \{SSPs\} but outcomes differ widely across them, with urbanization reaching
60\%, 79\%, and 92\% by the end of century in SSP3, SSP2, and SSP1/SSP4/SSP5, respectively. The degree of convergence
in urbanization across countries also differs substantially, with largely convergent outcomes by the end of the century
in \{SSP1\} and \{SSP5\} and persistent diversity in SSP3. This set of global, country-specific projections produces
urbanization pathways that are typical of regions in different stages of urbanization and development levels, and can be
extended to further elaborate assumptions about the styles of urban growth and spatial distributions of urban people

 producer behavior. Our key contribution is to represent the rate and biases of technical change by
 unobservable or latent variables. We also divide the rate of technical change between components that
 are induced by changes in prices and those that are autonomous and not affected by prices. In our dataset,
 production is disaggregated into 35 separate commodities produced by one or more of the 35 industries making
 up the US economy. Our second objective is to present a new econometric model of aggregate consumer behavior.
 The model allocates full wealth among time periods for households distinguished by demographic
 characteristics, and determines the within-period demands for leisure, consumer goods and services.
 An important feature of our approach is the development of a closed-form representation of aggregate
 demand and labor supply that accounts for the heterogeneity in household behavior that is observed in
 micro-level data. Our model of producer behavior is the supply side of general equilibrium models
 of the US. The aggregate demand functions are important components of the demand side. These general
 equilibrium models are used to analyze the consequences of a broad spectrum of public policies.
 These applications are discussed in more detail in Chapter 8 of this Handbook. The third objective
 of the chapter is to demonstrate an important benefit of the econometric approach to parameterization.
 The parameter covariances obtained in the course of estimation can be used to construct
 confidence intervals for endogenous variables in general equilibrium models. Confidence intervals
 characterize the precision of modeling results more rigorously and systematically than traditional sensitivity analysis.},

specifies demand and supply for agricultural and food commodities with global coverage and great
detail for low and middle income countries. It is shaped around FAOSTAT data on production and
commodity balance sheets, which enables a detailed specification of agricultural and food

simulate future food supply requirements in the context of changing demand and ambition to

 to project national populations based on alternative assumptions on future, fertility, mortality, migration and
 educational transitions that correspond to the five shared socioeconomic pathways (\{SSP\}) storylines.
 In doing so it goes a significant step beyond past population scenarios in the \{IPCC\} context which considered only
 total population size. By differentiating the human population not only by age and sex---as is conventionally done in
 demographic projections---but also by different levels of educational attainment the most fundamental aspects of
 human development and social change are being explicitly addressed through modeling the changing composition
 of populations by these three important individual characteristics. The scenarios have been defined in a
 collaborative effort of the international Integrated Assessment Modeling community with the medium scenario
 following that of a major new effort by the Wittgenstein Centre for Demography and Global Human Capital (IIASA, OEAW, WU)
 involving over 550 experts from around the world. As a result, in terms of total world population size the
 trajectories resulting from the five \{SSPs\} stay very close to each other until around 2030 and by the
 middle of the century already a visible differentiation appears with the range between the highest (\{SSP3\}) and the
 lowest (\{SSP1\}) trajectories spanning 1.5 billion. The range opens up much more with the \{SSP3\} reaching 12.6~billion
 in~2100 and \{SSP1\} falling to 6.9~billion which is lower than today's world population.},

base and modeling project represented a significant advance forward as it put modelers and trade policy analysts
on common ground. After an initial generation of GTAP based modeling of agricultural trade policy using the standard modeling framework, individual
researchers have begun introducing agricultural specificity into the standard modeling framework in order to better
capture the particular features of the agricultural economy pertinent to their research questions. This technical paper
follows in that same tradition by reviewing important linkages between international trade and the farm and food
economy and introducing them into the standard GTAP modeling framework, offering a special purpose version of the
model nicknamed GTAP-AGR. We introduce this agricultural specificity by introducing new behavioral relationships into the
standard GTAP framework. We focus particular attention on the factor markets, which play a critical role in determining
the incidence of producer subsidies. This includes modifying both the factor supply and derived demand equations. We
also modify the specification of consumer demand, assuming separability of food from non-food commodities. Finally, we
introduce the important substitution possibilities amongst feedstuffs used in the livestock sector. Where possible
we support these new behavioral relationships with literature-based estimates of both the mean and standard deviation of behavioral
parameters. The express purpose of this is to support systematic sensitivity analysis with respect to
policy reform scenarios performed with GTAP-AGR. In addition to documenting these extensions to the standard modeling framework, the
paper has an additional goal, and that is to gauge the performance of the GTAP-AGR model and how it differs from the
standard GTAP framework. We do this primarily by comparing the farm level supply and demand response in terms of
policy incidence for the two frameworks. In addition, we evaluate the ability of both models to reproduce observed price
volatility in an effort to validate the performance of these models. Finally, we evaluate the results of
the two models in a side-by-side comparison of results from full liberalization of agricultural and non-agricultural support.},

 2012: {\"Europe's waste would suffice twice to feed the world's

 in Europe and other prosperous countries while many people in
 poor countries are starving. Hence, it seems that the global hunger
 problem could be easily solved. People in rich countries would
 simply have to deal with food more responsibly.
 This policy brief critically examines the methodology of identification food loss and the magnitude of estimated quantities and
 values. Furthermore, it is questioned whether the potential reduction of food loss on one side can really decrease hunger on the
 other. The paper concludes with a discussion of morals and alternative options for combating hunger.},

  abstract = {Increasing global levels of meat consumption are a threat to the environment and to human health. To identify measures that may change consumption patterns towards more plant-based foods, it is necessary to improve our understanding of the causes behind the demand for meat. In this paper we use data from 137 different countries to identify and assess factors that influence meat consumption at the national level using a cross-country multivariate regression analysis. We specify either total meat or ruminant meat as the dependent variable and we consider a broad range of potential drivers of meat consumption. The combination of explanatory variables we use is new for this type of analysis. In addition, we estimate the relative importance of the different drivers. We find that income per capita followed by rate of urbanisation are the two most important drivers of total meat consumption per capita. Income per capita and natural endowment factors are major drivers of ruminant meat consumption per capita. Other drivers are Western culture, Muslim religion, female labour participation, economic and social globalisation and meat prices. The main identified drivers of meat demand are difficult to influence through direct policy intervention. Thus, acting indirectly on consumers� preferences and consumption habits (for instance through information, education policy and increased availability of ready-made plant based products) could be of key importance for mitigating the rise of meat consumption per capita all over the world.},

  abstract = {Our understanding of food security in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA) has been hampered by limitations in the temporal and spatial representativeness of data. Food balance sheets provide scalable estimates of per capita food availability, but fail to represent food access, stability and their causal linkages. In contrast, rural household surveys represent detailed conditions for one or multiple points in time, but are influenced by survey timing and are often limited in geographical coverage. This study draws on a large sample of rural land-holding households in SSA (n = 6,353) to identify household level food access deficiencies and to understand the associations with rural livelihoods and food sourcing behavior throughout the year. Food access deficiencies were identified using food security of access and diet diversity indicators. Dietary diversity and channel of access (farm or purchased) were enumerated for the �flush� and �lean� periods and food security of access was enumerated for the lean period only - making the results of this study independent of survey timing. As many as 39\% of households were classified as severely food insecure (in terms of food access) and as many as 49\% of households were likely to be deficient in micronutrients in the lean period. Vulnerability to food insecurity and micronutrient deficiencies differed by household composition, agricultural livelihood characteristics and agro-ecological zone. Dairy, fruit and vitamin A-rich produce were predominantly accessed through the farm channel. Households with a livestock component to their farm had a lower prevalence of severe food insecurity and higher diet diversity scores. These findings have implications for the development of nutrition-sensitive and nutrition-specific interventions. Interventions need to be tailored to agro-ecological zone, household composition, scale of operation and production mix. Increasing income will not necessarily result in improved diet diversity or healthy dietary choices. Interventions focused on income generation should monitor and promote crop and livestock production diversity and provide nutrition education.},

Often, analysts have used approximations to a full global MRIO model; however, without access to a full MRIO model the approximation errors are unknown. In this paper we use an MRIO model based on the dataset provided by the Global Trade Analysis Project (GTAP) to quantify the errors introduced by various approximations of the full MRIO model. We find that emissions embodied in imports contribute an average 40\% of the total emissions embodied in countries' final demands. For the emissions embodied in imports, we find: (a) that the unidirectional trade model gives a good approximation to the full MRIO model when the number of regions in the model is small; (b) that including only the most important trade partner in terms of emissions embodied in imports can substantially improve the accuracy of estimates; and (c) that a world-average input�output table often provides a good representation of the aggregate �rest of world� economy. Finally, assuming that imports are produced with domestic technology (Domestic Technology Assumption, DTA) in an MRIO model can introduce significant errors and requires careful validation before results are used. However, the DTA generally produces better estimates than ignoring imports altogether.},

The scenario family is characterized by rapid and fossil-fueled development with high socio-economic challenges to mitigation
and low socio-economic challenges to adaptation (SSP5). A special focus is placed on the \{SSP5\} marker scenario developed by the
REMIND-MAgPIE integrated assessment modeling framework. The \{SSP5\} baseline scenarios exhibit very high levels of fossil fuel use,
up to a doubling of global food demand, and up to a tripling of energy demand and greenhouse gas emissions over the course of the
century, marking the upper end of the scenario literature in several dimensions. These scenarios are currently the only \{SSP\} scenarios
that result in a radiative forcing pathway as high as the highest Representative Concentration Pathway (RCP8.5).
This paper further investigates the direct impact of mitigation policies on the \{SSP5\} energy, land and emissions dynamics
confirming high socio-economic challenges to mitigation in SSP5. Nonetheless, mitigation policies reaching climate forcing levels as low as in
the lowest Representative Concentration Pathway (RCP2.6) are accessible in SSP5. The \{SSP5\} scenarios presented in this paper
aim to provide useful reference points for future climate change, climate impact, adaption and mitigation analysis, and
broader questions of sustainable development.},

 consequences of anthropogenic climate change and available response options.
 A more consistent use of socio-economic scenarios that would allow an integrated
 perspective on mitigation, adaptation and residual climate impacts remains a major challenge.
 We assert that the identification of a set of global narratives and socio-economic pathways
 offering scalability to different regional contexts, a reasonable coverage of key
 socio-economic dimensions and relevant futures, and a sophisticated approach to separating
 climate policy from counter-factual {"no policy"} scenarios would be an important step toward
 meeting this challenge. To this end, we introduce the concept of {"shared socio-economic
 (reference) pathways"}. Sufficient coverage of the relevant socio-economic dimensions my be
 achieved by locating the pathways along the dimensions of challenges to mitigation
 and to adaptation. The pathways should be specified in an iterative manner and with close collaboration
 between integrated assessment modelers and impact, adaptation and vulnerability researchers to
 assure coverage of key dimensions, sufficient scalability and widespread adoption.
 They can be used not only as inputs to analyses, but also to collect the results of different
 climate change analyses in a matrix defined by two dimensions: climate exposure as characterized
 by a radiative forcing or temperature level and socio-economic development as classified by the pathways.
 For some applications, socio-economic pathways may have to be augmented by {"shared climate policy assumptions"}
 capturing global components of climate policies that some studies may require as inputs.
 We conclude that the development of shared socio-economic (reference) pathways,
 and integrated socio-economic scenarios more broadly, is a useful focal point
 for collaborative efforts between integrated assessment and impact, adaptation and vulnerability researchers.},

measures are egregiously flawed. This paper shows how appropriate tariff aggregation can overcome underestimation
of both efficiency and terms-of-trade gains from reform. The improvement is shown to result
from better measurement of a distortion effect that is most important in the early stages of reform and a
weighting effect that becomes more important as protection is reduced. Applications confirm that the technique
can be applied relatively easily, and—with elasticity estimates suggested by the available econometric
evidence—point to close to a doubling of the global welfare gains from global trade reform, and dramatic
changes in the measured welfare impacts in many individual cases. Sensitivity analysis suggests that, for
global trade reform, the ease of substitution between tariff lines is much more important than that between
varieties from different countries. We provide an online aggregation tool to allow replication of our analysis
or investigation of alternative scenarios for global reform. We hope that this paper will contribute both to
wider use of optimal aggregators and improved estimates of the key elasticity parameters},

 We find that the tiered formula for agriculture would halve tariffs in industrial countries and lower them
 more modestly in developing countries. In non-agricultural market access (NAMA), the formulas would reduce
 the tariff peaks facing developing countries and cut average industrial country tariffs by more than a third.
 We use a political-economy framework to assess the implications of flexibilities for the size of the tariff cuts
 and find they are likely to substantially reduce the outcome. However, despite the flexibilities, there are likely
 to be worthwhile gains, with applied tariffs facing developing countries cut by about 20\% in agriculture and 28\% in NAMA,
 and sizeable cuts in tariffs facing industrial countries. The welfare impacts of reform are evaluated using a
 new approach to aggregation that improves on the traditional, flawed approach of weighted-average tariffs.
 This substantially increases the estimated benefits of an agreement along the lines of these modalities,
 with estimated global income gains of up to \$160 billion per year from market access reform.},

We call this model and the ancillary programming tools GTAPinGAMS. Relative to previous installments of GTAPinGAMS, an innovation in this model is that it can easily switch between global multiregional (GMR) and small open economy (SOE) closures. We also include the possibility to evaluate results for alternative representations of final demand, based on Cobb-Douglas, linear expenditure system or constant difference in elasticities demand systems. In this paper we outline the model structure, document the associated equilibrium conditions and describe computer programs which calibrate the model to the desired regional and sectoral aggregation from the GTAP 9 dataset. We perform a few calculations which illustrate how alternative structural assumptions influence the policy conclusions derived from the model.},

  abstract = {Global \{GDP\} projections for the 21st century are needed for the exploration of long-term global
environmental problems, in particular climate change. Greenhouse gas emissions as well as climate change mitigation and adaption
capacities strongly depend on growth of per capita income. However, long-term economic projections are highly uncertain. This paper provides
five new long-term economic scenarios as part of the newly developed shared socio-economic pathways (SSPs) which
represent a set of widely diverging narratives. A method of \{GDP\} scenario building is presented that is based on
assumptions about technological progress, and human and physical capital formation as major drivers of long-term \{GDP\} per capita growth.
The impact of these drivers differs significantly between different shared socio-economic pathways and is traced back to the
underlying narratives and the associated population and education scenarios. In a highly fragmented world, technological and
knowledge spillovers are low. Hence, the growth impact of technological progress and human capital is comparatively low, and per capita income
diverges between world regions. These factors play a much larger role in globalization scenarios, leading to higher economic growth
and stronger convergence between world regions. At the global average, per capita \{GDP\} is projected to grow annually in a range
between 1.0\% (SSP3) and 2.8\% (SSP5) from 2010 to 2100. While this covers a large portion of variety in future global economic
growth projections, plausible lower and higher growth projections may still be conceivable. The \{GDP\} projections are put
into the context of historic patterns of economic growth (stylized facts), and their sensitivity to key assumptions is explored.},

  abstract = {Incorporating water into a computable general equilibrium (CGE) model operating at global scale
can be extremely demanding due to the absence of standardized data, the sheer dimensions
caused by intersecting river basins with countries, and difficulties to model demand for and supply of water.
This has led many authors to introduce water in their CGE modeling framework in different ways and at
different spatial and sectoral aggregation levels. Of course, simplifying market for water and
sacrificing the geographical realism risk introducing errors caused by inappropriate aggregation.
In this paper, we use an elaborate global CGE model to investigate the three most commonly practiced simplifications:
(1) tackling global questions in a national level model;
(2) collapsing irrigated and rainfed crop production into a single sector; and
(3) removing river basin boundaries within a country. In each case, we compare their performance
in predicting the impacts of future irrigation scarcity on international trade,
crop output, land use change and welfare, relative to the full scale model.
As might be expected, the single region model does a good job of matching outcomes for that region,
although changes in bilateral trade can entail significant errors. When it comes to the elimination of
sub-national river basins and irrigation location, we find that, if the research question has to do
with changes in national-scale trade, production and welfare changes, it may be sufficient to
ignore the sub-national hydrological boundaries in global economic analysis of water scarcity.
However, when decision makers have an interest in the distribution of inputs and outputs within a region,
preserving the river basin and sectoral detail in the model brings considerable added value to the analysis.},

especially the restrictive effect of water on food production in hot spots where irrigation stress is growing.
However, little is known about the larger-scale implications of future irrigation shortfalls for global
trade and economic welfare, as well as of the potential buffering impacts of international trade on the local
impacts of irrigation shortage. In this paper, we utilize a recently developed model, GTAP-BIO-W,
to study the economic effects of changes in irrigation outlook for 126 river basins, globally by 2030.
Projected irrigation availability is obtained from the IMPACT-WATER model, and imposed
upon the present-day economy. Irrigation availability in 2030 is expected to drop by 30--60\% in several
key rivers basins, including: Hai He, Indus, Luni, and the Eastern Mediterranean basin, leading
to significant output declines in China, South Asia, and the Middle East.
We find that the regional production impacts of future irrigation water shortages are quite heterogeneous,
depending on the size of the shortfall, the irrigation intensity of crop production,
the possibility of expanding rainfed areas, as well as the crop mix. These changes in regional output
significantly alter the geography of international trade. To compensate for the loss of productivity caused
by the irrigation constraint, an estimated 7.6 million hectares of cropland expansion is
needed to meet the demand for food. In spite of the remarkable reduction of irrigation in some basins,
the resulting welfare impact is relatively modest as a result of the buffering capacity of global markets.
The global welfare loss amounts to \$3.7 billion (2001 prices) and results from a combination of the reduction in irrigation
availability as well as the interplay with agricultural support policies.},

  abstract   = {Successful adaptation of agriculture to ongoing climate changes would help to maintain productivity growth and
 thereby reduce pressure to bring new lands into agriculture. In this paper we investigate the potential co-benefits of
 adaptation in terms of the avoided emissions from land use change. A model of global agricultural trade and land use,
 called SIMPLE, is utilized to link adaptation investments, yield growth rates, land conversion rates, and land use
 emissions. A scenario of global adaptation to offset negative yield impacts of temperature and precipitation changes
 to 2050, which requires a cumulative 225 billion USD of additional investment, results in 61~Mha less conversion of
 cropland and 15~Gt carbon dioxide equivalent ({CO2}e) fewer emissions by 2050. Thus our estimates imply an annual
 mitigation co-benefit of 0.35~Gt{CO2}/yr while spending \$15 per tonne {CO2}e of avoided emissions.
 Uncertainty analysis is used to estimate a 5-95\% confidence interval around these numbers of 0.25-0.43~Gt
 and \$11-\$22 per tonne {CO2}e. A scenario of adaptation focused only on Sub-Saharan Africa
 and Latin America, while less costly in aggregate, results in much smaller mitigation potentials and higher per
 tonne costs. These results indicate that although investing in the least developed areas may be most desirable
 for the main objectives of adaptation, it has little net effect on mitigation because production gains are offset
 by greater rates of land clearing in the benefited regions, which are relatively low yielding and land abundant.
 Adaptation investments in high yielding, land scarce regions such as Asia and North America are more effective for mitigation.
 To identify data needs, we conduct a sensitivity analysis using the Morris method (Morris 1991 \textit{Technometrics}~\textbf{33}~161-74).
 The three most critical parameters for improving estimates of mitigation potential are (in descending order)
 the emissions factors for converting land to agriculture, the price elasticity of land supply with respect to land rents,
 and the elasticity of substitution between land and non-land inputs.
 For assessing the mitigation costs, the elasticity of productivity with respect to investments in research and development
 is also very important. Overall, this study finds that broad-based efforts to adapt agriculture to climate change
 have mitigation co-benefits that, even when forced to shoulder the entire expense of adaptation, are inexpensive
 relative to many activities whose main purpose is mitigation. These results therefore challenge the current approach
 of most climate financing portfolios, which support adaptation from funds completely separate from---and
 often much smaller than---mitigation ones.},

 is accompanied by a CD-ROM that includes the GAMS software (free demo system),

 a standardized framework for analysis, the analyst is not forced to make
 'one-size-fits-all' assumptions. The GAMS code is written to give the analyst
 considerable flexibility in model specification.

 Over the past decade, the increasing power and reliability of microcomputers and the development
 of sophisticated software designed specifically for use with them has led to significant
 changes in the way quantitative food policy analysis is conducted. These changes
 cover most aspects of the analysis, ranging from the collections and analysis
 of socioeconomic data to the conduct of model-based policy simulations.
 As with any new technology, however, substantial costs in time and money are
 involved in learning the most efficient ways of using this new technology and
 then transmitting these lessons to others. This series, Microcomputers in
 Policy Research, represents IFPRI's ongoing collective experience in adapting
 microcomputer technology for use in food policy analysis in developing countries.
 The series is designed to provide hands-on methods for quantities food policy analysis.
 The purpose of the fifth volume in the series is to contribute to and facilitate the
 use of this class of models in developing countries. The model is written for application
 at the country level; however, only minimal changes are needed before it can be applied
 to a region within a country (such as a village) or to a farm household involved in
 production and consumption activities. The model incorporates features developed over recent
 years through IFPRI's research projects. These features-of particular importance in developing
 countries-include household consumption of nonmarketed ('home') commodities, explicit
 treatment of transaction costs for commodities that enter the market sphere,
 and a separation be-tween production activities and commodities that permits any activity
 to produce multiple commodities and any commodity to be produced by multiple activities.

 targets will require substantial amounts of bioenergy as part of the future energy mix. In the
 course of the Agricultural Model Intercomparison and Improvement Project {(AgMIP)}, five global
 agro-economic models were used to analyze a future scenario with global demand for ligno-cellulosic
 bioenergy rising to about 100 ExaJoule in 2050. From this exercise a tentative conclusion can
 be drawn that ambitious climate change mitigation need not drive up global food prices much, if the
 extra land required for bioenergy production is accessible or if the feedstock, for example,
 from forests, does not directly compete for agricultural land. Agricultural price effects across
 models by the year 2050 from high bioenergy demand in an ambitious mitigation scenario appear to
 be much smaller (+5\% average across models) than from direct climate impacts on crop yields in a
 high-emission scenario (+25\% average across models). However, potential future scarcities of water
 and nutrients, policy-induced restrictions on agricultural land expansion, as well as potential
 welfare losses have not been specifically looked at in this exercise.},

 Whether one is interested in the outlook for global commodity markets, future patterns of
 international trade, or the interactions between land use, deforestation and ecological
 diversity, the rate of productivity growth in agriculture is an essential input. Yet solid
 projections for this variable have proven elusive---particularly on a global basis. This is
 due, in no small part, to the difficulty in measuring historical productivity growth. The
 purpose of this paper is to report the latest time series evidence on total factor productivity
 growth for crops, ruminants and non-ruminant livestock, on a global basis. We then follow
 with tests for convergence amongst regions, providing forecasts for farm productivity
 growth to the year 2040. The results suggest that most regions in the sample are likely to
 experience larger productivity gains in livestock than in crops. Within livestock, the nonruminant
 sector is expected to continue to be more dynamic than the ruminant sector.
 Given the rapid rates of productivity growth observed recently, non-ruminant and crop
 productivity in developing countries may be converging to the productivity levels of
 developed countries. For ruminants, the results show that productivity levels may be
 diverging between developed and developing countries.},

 impacts on agricultural markets and land-use patterns because often aggregation is across steep
 gradients from low to high impacts or from increases to decreases. The four climate change impact
 scenarios supplied here were designed to represent the most significant impacts (high emission scenario only,
 assumed ineffectiveness of carbon dioxide fertilization on agricultural yields, no adjustments in management)
 but are consistent with the assumption that changes in agricultural practices are covered in the economic models.
 Globally, production of individual crops decrease by 10--38\% under these climate change scenarios,
 with large uncertainties in spatial patterns that are determined by both the uncertainty in climate
 projections and the choice of impact model. This uncertainty in climate impact on crop productivity
 needs to be considered by economic assessments of climate change.},

  abstract = {Abstract Ensembles of process-based crop models are increasingly used to simulate crop growth for
 scenarios of temperature and/or precipitation changes corresponding to different projections of
 atmospheric {CO2} concentrations. This approach generates large datasets with thousands of simulated crop yield data.
 Such datasets potentially provide new information but it is difficult to summarize them in a useful way
 due to their structural complexities. An associated issue is that it is not straightforward to compare
 crops and to interpolate the results to alternative climate scenarios not initially included in the simulation protocols.
 Here we demonstrate that statistical models based on random-coefficient regressions are able to emulate ensembles
 of process-based crop models. An important advantage of the proposed statistical models is that they can
 interpolate between temperature levels and between {CO2} concentration levels, and can thus be used to calculate
 temperature and [CO2] thresholds leading to yield loss or yield gain, without re-running the original complex crop models.
 Our approach is illustrated with three yield datasets simulated by 19 maize models,
 26 wheat models, and 13 rice models. Several statistical models are fitted to these datasets,
 and are then used to analyze the variability of the yield response to [CO2] and temperature.
 Based on our results, we show that, for wheat, a [CO2] increase is likely to outweigh the negative effect
 of a temperature increase of +2 degree C in the considered sites. Compared to wheat, required levels
 of [CO2] increase are much higher for maize, and intermediate for rice. For all crops,
 uncertainties in simulating climate change impacts increase more with temperature than with elevated [CO2].},

  abstract    = {The occurrence and quantity of world petroleum resources appears to be well understood. The
numbers are so great, however, that even minor variants in the total picture can be responsible for enormous
localized industrial activity. Specific knowledge of the widespread local occurrences of oil and gas, therefore, is
important to economic development and to the free market distribution of energy. It is also clear, however, that
a large proportion of the recoverable petroleum resources are found in only a few selected localities.

We believe that, worldwide, recoverable conventional oil and gas exist in ultimate quantities approximating
2300 billion barrels (370 $\textrm{Gm}^3$) of oil and 12 O00 trillion cubic feet (340 $\textrm{Tm}^3$) of gas. These values are limited by
our concepts of world petroleum geology and our understanding of specific basins; nonetheless, continued
expansion of exploration activity, around the world, has resulted in only minimal adjustments to our quantitative
understanding of ultimate resources.

Reserves reporting has been one of the greatest hindrances to a thorough understanding of world resources
because we are just now gaining an understanding of field growth and what is actually being calculated and
reported from various localities.

Unconventional resources are present in large quantities, in particular in the Western Hemisphere, and are of
a dimension to substantially contribute to world reserves should economic conditions permit.},

  abstract    = {The GTAP model, versions 4.1 and lower, suffers from some defects in the implementation of
 the regional household demand system. Most seriously, the upper level of the demand system assumes
 that each regional household faces a fixed price for utility from private consumption. But with a
 private consumption demand system of the CDE form, the price of utility from private consumption
 depends on the level of private consumption expenditure. With no fixed price for utility from
 private consumption, the familiar Cobb-Douglas demand system does not apply. Accordingly,
 the upper-level demand equations are in error.

 Furthermore, utility and equivalent variation are wrongly computed in simulations with non-standard settings
 for the CDE expansion parameters. Even with the standard settings, in multi-step simulations
 the utility and equivalent variation computations are inexact. The welfare decomposition inherits
 the defects of the equivalent variation computation.

 In removing these defects we revise in passing some minor misfeatures of the old treatment:
 Firstly, we treat the entire final demand system as the demand system of a representative household,
 rather than a conglomeration of representative and region-wide demand systems (subsection 2.6).
 Secondly, we provide a new facility for shifting the allocation of regional income exogenously by
 modifying rather than overriding the final demand system (subsection 2.14).
 Finally, we eliminate an uninterpretable {"nuisance term"} from the decomposition of equivalent
 variation (subsection 4.3).},

The paper shows how the exposure to trade will induce only the more productive firms to enter the export market (while some less productive firms continue to produce only for the domestic market) and will simultaneously force the least productive firms to exit. It then shows how further increases in the industry's exposure to trade lead to additional inter-firm reallocations towards more productive firms. These phenomena have been empirically documented but can not be explained by current general equilibrium trade models, because they rely on a representative firm framework. The paper also shows how the aggregate industry productivity growth generated by the reallocations contributes to a welfare gain, thus highlighting a benefit from trade that has not been examined theoretically before. The paper adapts Hopenhayn's (1992a) dynamic industry model to monopolistic competition in a general equilibrium setting. In so doing, the paper provides an extension of Krugman's (1980) trade model that incorporates firm level productivity differences. Firms with different productivity levels coexist in an industry because each firm faces initial uncertainty concerning its productivity before making an irreversible investment to enter the industry. Entry into the export market is also costly, but the firm's decision to export occurs after it gains knowledge of its productivity.},

 between the United States of America and Brazil driven by their different biofuel policies. The
 trend emerged in 2010, and accelerated in the second half of 2011, with large quantities of
 ethanol crossing paths in bilateral trade between the two countries. While this two-way or intraindustry
 trade of homogenous products is not a new phenomenon, it is typically explained by
 factors such as seasonality or cross-border exchanges caused by transportation cost differentials.
 However, we find that traditional market factors do not explain the notable volumes of bilateral
 trade in ethanol between the US and Brazil. Instead, this trade appears to be driven by
 differential and uncoordinated environmental policy. The conclusion is that the uncoordinated
 environmental legislation is inducing the product differentiation that invites arbitrage between
 the two countries, resulting in the two-way trade of an otherwise physically homogenous product;
 in so doing, additional fossil energy is consumed in the bilateral trade of ethanol along with
 the associated emissions of greenhouse gases (GHGs) from transport. Transport, as a result of
 the individual policies, also raises the price of biofuels to consumers which may suppress the
 displacement of fossil fuels. Both of these unintended consequences work in direct conflict with
 stated environmental objectives of many biofuel programmes.
 The potential for intra-industry trade in biofuels could be further stimulated by evolving legislation
 within the European Union (EU). With tighter environmental constraints on biofuel production
 written into EU policy, the potential competition for certain classes of renewable fuels increases
 and could extend its reach from ethanol to biodiesel and/or the underlying feedstocks in the EU,
 the US and Brazil. This would create additional opportunities for counter-productive arbitrage
 among the three regions. We highlight one negative consequence of uncoordinated biofuel policy
 and propose options for mitigation through the use of a {"book and claim"} system under which
 each country could continue to pursue its own policy objectives while acting in a coordinated
 fashion to reduce costs and GHG emissions.},

 Informed by an exploratory qualitative case study of third sector actors in north east England,
 this paper explores the logics of surplus food redistribution. The framings and qualities (logics) ascribed to surplus
 foods as they flow through the food chain are examined, following an economy of qualities approach. Existing literature
 constructs surplus food and those involved in its utilisation as beyond market mechanisms and relations. This is challenged
 by the research that suggests the practices are never independent of their market attachment and reflect a continuum of food
 system flows and relationships, concerning the management of economic, environmental and social qualities and relations.
 The paper concludes that unless a distinction is drawn between genuine waste to be recovered and surplus to be redistributed
 for community benefit, surplus food as a resource is unlikely to be fully utilised.},

data from the most recent version of the World Income Inequality Database (WIID). The picture that emerges
using 'absolute,' and even 'centrist' measures of inequality, is very different from the results
obtained using standard 'relative' inequality measures such as the Gini coefficient or Coefficient of Variation.
Relative global inequality has declined substantially over the decades.
In contrast, 'absolute' inequality, as captured by the Standard Deviation and Absolute Gini,
has increased considerably and unabated. Like these 'absolute' measures, our 'centrist' inequality indicators,
the Krtscha measure and an intermediate Gini, also register a pronounced increase in global inequality, albeit,
in the case of the latter, with a decline during 2005 to 2010. A critical question posed
by our findings is whether increased levels of inequality according to absolute and centrist measures are
inevitable at today's per capita income levels. Our analysis suggests that it is not possible
for absolute inequality to return to 1975 levels without further convergence in mean
incomes among countries. Inequality, as captured by centrist measures such as the Krtscha,
could return to 1975 levels, at today's domestic and global per capita income levels, but
this would require quite dramatic structural reforms to reduce domestic inequality levels in most countries.},

Here we consider how consuming an additional serving per day of each of 15 foods is associated with 5 health outcomes in adults and 5 aspects of agriculturally driven environmental degradation. We find that while there is substantial variation in the health outcomes of different foods, foods associated with a larger reduction in disease risk for one health outcome are often associated with larger reductions in disease risk for other health outcomes. Likewise, foods with lower impacts on one metric of environmental harm tend to have lower impacts on others. Additionally, of the foods associated with improved health (whole grain cereals, fruits, vegetables, legumes, nuts, olive oil, and fish), all except fish have among the lowest environmental impacts, and fish has markedly lower impacts than red meats and processed meats. Foods associated with the largest negative environmental impacts�unprocessed and processed red meat�are consistently associated with the largest increases in disease risk. Thus, dietary transitions toward greater consumption of healthier foods would generally improve environmental sustainability, although processed foods high in sugars harm health but can have relatively low environmental impacts. These findings could help consumers, policy makers, and food companies to better understand the multiple health and environmental implications of food choices.},

The GTAP model has been updated overtime, but it maintains the structure of a single regional household, with
income distributed into three components: government, private and savings-investment expenditures. There has been a need for a
more detailed accounting system, especially as it relates to estimating the potential impacts of policies and global shocks on poverty, sustainable and inclusive growth.

This paper (and its companion paper) present a method for splitting the GTAP regional
household and linking these households to factor incomes and taxes. It introduces a user friendly GEMPACK based
application, MyGTAP, for splitting the GTAP regional household based on basic data and splitting shares which may be obtained
from a Social Accounting Matrix (SAM); this greatly reduces the development requirements for introducing multiple households into the GTAP
model. The introduction of a split regional household (which does not require splitting data for every region) supports economic
analysis based on detailed households, government, factor income, remittances, foreign aid and income transfers. The splitting method
is based on the normalized GTAP database found in SplitCom, however, it is shown in the paper that this approach is easily reconciled
and is consistent within a SAM framework. The code can be modified to include multiple split regions with unique household structures.

This paper is a guide to employing the data tools and programs for splitting the regional household and factors
of production in the GTAP database. It is intended to be used in tandem with a complimentary paper detailing the theory, accounting and
model code "MyGTAP Model: A Model for Employing Data from the MyGTAP Data Program: Multiple Households, Split Factors,

 article comes from computational models that are deterministic, complicated enough to make classical
 mathematical analysis impractical and that have a moderate-to-large number of inputs. The problem of
 designing computational experiments to determine which inputs have important effects on an output is
 considered. The proposed experimental plans are composed of individually randomized one-factor-at-a-time designs,
 and data analysis is based on the resulting random sample of observed elementary effects, those changes
 in an output due solely to changes in a particular input. Advantages of this approach include a lack
 of reliance on assumptions of relative sparsity of important inputs, monotonicity of outputs with respect to inputs,
 or adequacy of a low-order polynomial as an approximation to the computational model.},

 comprehensive analyses of climate change impacts, including global market feedbacks are still lacking.
 In the context of uneven impacts of climate change across regions interconnected through trade, climate change impact
 and adaptation policies in one region need to be assessed in a global framework. Focusing on four Eastern Asian countries
 and using a global integrated modeling framework we show that i) once imports are considered, the overall climate change
 impact on the amount of food available could be of opposite sign to the direct domestic impacts and ii) production and trade
 adjustments following price signals could reduce the spread of climate change impacts on food availability. We then investigated
 how pressure on the food system in Eastern Asia could be mitigated by a consumer support policy. We found that the costs of adaptation
 policies to 2050 varied greatly across climate projections. The costs of consumer support policies would also be lower if only
 implemented in one region but market price leakage could exacerbate pressure on food systems in other regions. We conclude
 that climate adaptation should no longer be viewed only as a geographically isolated local problem.},

Partial Equilibrium (PE) models used for disaggregate analysis lack the benefits of an economy-wide analysis required to examine the overall impact of trade policy reforms. This suggests the need for a PE-GE, nested modeling framework to support trade policy analysis. In this paper, we develop a PE model that captures international trade, domestic consumption and output, using CET and CES structures, market clearing conditions and price linkages, nested within the standard GTAP Model. In addition, we extend the welfare decomposition of Huff and Hertel (2001) to this PE-GE model to contrast the sources of welfare gain among models. To illustrate the value-added of this model, we examine the impact of multi-lateral tariff liberalization on the Indian economy, with special focus on the auto sector, using PE, GE and PE-GE models. The PE model does not predict the change in overall size and price level for the industry well, while the GE model underestimates the aggregate welfare gain due to tariff averaging. It also fails to account for the change in industry composition resulting from trade reform. These findings are robust to wide variation in model parameters. We conclude that the linked model is superior to both the GE and PE counterparts.},

 The special issue includes seven peer-reviewed articles that present thematic results from a range of

 myriad of differences within these two model types. A central common element is harmonization on
 biophysical effects using crop models and socioeconomic effects using drivers from the Shared

  abstract   = {Agricultural production is sensitive to weather and thus directly affected by climate change.
 Plausible estimates of these climate change impacts require combined use of climate, crop, and
 economic models. Results from previous studies vary substantially due to differences in models, scenarios,
 and data. This paper is part of a collective effort to systematically integrate these three types of models.
 We focus on the economic component of the assessment, investigating how nine global economic models of
 agriculture represent endogenous responses to seven standardized climate change scenarios produced by two
 climate and five crop models. These responses include adjustments in yields, area, consumption, and
 international trade. We apply biophysical shocks derived from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate
 Change's representative concentration pathway with end-of-century radiative forcing of 8.5 W/m2. The mean
 biophysical yield effect with no incremental {CO2} fertilization is a 17\% reduction globally by 2050
 relative to a scenario with unchanging climate. Endogenous economic responses reduce yield loss to 11\%,
 increase area of major crops by 11\%, and reduce consumption by 3\%. Agricultural production, cropland area,
 trade, and prices show the greatest degree of variability in response to climate change, and consumption the
 lowest. The sources of these differences include model structure and specification; in particular,
 model assumptions about ease of land use conversion, intensification, and trade. This study identifies
 where models disagree on the relative responses to climate shocks and highlights research activities needed
 to improve the representation of agricultural adaptation responses to climate change.},

  abstract   = {Agriculture is unique among economic sectors in the nature of impacts from climate change.
 The production activity that transforms inputs into agricultural outputs involves direct use of
 weather inputs (temperature, solar radiation available to the plant, and precipitation). Previous studies
 of the impacts of climate change on agriculture have reported substantial differences in outcomes such as
 prices, production, and trade arising from differences in model inputs and model specification. This article
 presents climate change results and underlying determinants from a model comparison exercise with 10 of the
 leading global economic models that include significant representation of agriculture. By harmonizing
 key drivers that include climate change effects, differences in model outcomes were reduced. The particular
 choice of climate change drivers for this comparison activity results in large and negative productivity effects.
 All models respond with higher prices. Producer behavior differs by model with some emphasizing area response
 and others yield response. Demand response is least important. The differences reflect both differences
 in model specification and perspectives on the future. The results from this study highlight the need to
 more fully compare the deep model parameters, to generate a call for a combination of econometric and
 validation studies to narrow the degree of uncertainty and variability in these parameters and to move
 to Monte Carlo type simulations to better map the contours of economic uncertainty.},

  abstract       = {There is an increase in requirement and competition for water, while water resources are decreasing at an accelerating rate. Agriculture is the biggest consumer of water and therefore has the largest water footprint, which is not yet known. The largest portion is acknowledged to be for producing animal products. Water footprints account for the amounts of water used to produce a commodity for consumption, measured along the commodity life cycle. Water withdrawals from surface and groundwater are accounted for when assessing the water footprint. The three identified major determinants of a water footprint of meat include feed conversion efficiency (FCE), feed composition, and feed origin, with the first two being influenced greatly by the animal production system. In South Africa (SA), the two distinct production systems are the intensive and extensive production systems. Intensifying beef animals improves FCE due to faster growths per kg feed consumed, reduced activity, and therefore reduced water footprint. Beef cattle in the extensive system consume a large component of roughages, while the intensive system has a high concentrate to roughage ratio. This theoretically increases the water footprint in the intensive system. The literature indicates large amounts of volumetric water footprint indicators of boneless beef in SA. Water footprint assessment is critical for enabling consumers to make well-informed and sound decisions when considering changes in their behavior due to the effect this has on social, economic, and environmental wellbeing. This paper aims to postulate the various issues associated with water usage in beef production. These include factors affecting the water footprint of beef production and the effects it has on various aspects of both the environment and social wellbeing. It further explores the various methods to assess the water footprint of a product.},

in the context of food supply chains (FSCs) operating within the rapidly developing

undertaken the transformation from centrally-planned to more market-based
systems, such as those in the former Soviet Union and the Communist bloc
countries of Europe). It considers the challenges in measuring progress towards
global food waste reduction, and why knowledge on food losses within BRIC and
transition countries represents such a significant gap in the evidence required to
monitor global food waste reductions. Priorities for food waste reduction within these
countries are discussed using evidence gathered from an expert workshop on food
waste and interviews conducted with global FSC experts. The conventional view that
post-consumer food waste is a problem of industrialised countries alone is
contradicted by the evidence, with some BRIC countries experiencing similarly high
levels of food discard. The nature of food waste and post-harvest losses are
considered in the global context, followed by a discussion of how global monitoring
might be improved. The priority areas for addressing food losses within BRIC and
transition economies are then discussed in relation to evidence from the expert
workshop and FSC interviews. Emergent FSC innovations relevant to the reduction
of losses within the FSC and within the home are presented. Finally, the prospects
for global food waste reduction to 2050 are considered.},

food waste and estimates varied widely; those for post-harvest losses of grain in developing countries
might be overestimated. As much of the post-harvest loss data for developing countries was collected over
30 years ago, current global losses cannot be quantified. A significant gap exists in the understanding of
the food waste implications of the rapid development of BRIC economies. The limited data suggest that
losses are much higher at the immediate post-harvest stages in developing countries and higher for
perishable foods across industrialized and developing economies alike. For affluent economies,
post-consumer food waste accounts for the greatest overall losses. To supplement the
fragmentary picture and to gain a forward view, interviews were conducted with international FSC
experts. The analyses highlighted the scale of the problem, the scope for improved system efficiencies
and the challenges of affecting behavioural change to reduce post-consumer waste in affluent populations.},

1700 and ending in 2007. In order to solve this problem, we use the FAOSTAT data
base developed by the Food and Agricultural Organization (FAO) of the United Nations.
Currently, this data base provides land cover data at the country level up to 2011.

Following the earlier versions of the GTAP land use data bases, we also rely on the
FAOSTAT data to update the GTAP data on harvested areas and crops produced in 2011.
This paper is divided into sections with each one covering a particular part of the update for land use database.
Following are the main components:
\begin{itemize}
\item{Land cover development items by country, region and AEZ}
\item{Comparison in land cover data between 2004 and 2011}
\item{Harvested area and crop production by country, region and AEZ}
\item{Crop production and harvested area by crop, region and AEZ}
\item{Changes in harvested area and crop production for 2004-2011}
\end{itemize}
Thus, this document provides a complete description of the new land use database and compares 2004 with 2011.},

 can be used to obtain arbitrarily accurate solutions to simulations. The key is a method for translating
 a simulation problem directly to a so-called initial value problem. Since many different methods for solving
 initial value problems are known and well understood, and since each one converts to an algorithm for solving
 simulation problems, this insight greatly expands the computational tool kit for conducting simulations.
 This paper contains a survey of the theoretical results guaranteeing convergence and forming the basis
 for extrapolations of two important methods for solving initial value problems. Theoretical considerations
 suggest that the faster rate of convergence of one of these methods (the modified midpoint method) is likely
 to cause it to dominate the other (Euler's method) in many situations faced by applied general equilibrium modellers.
 The other main points of the paper are: (a) to emphasize that linearized (symbolic) representations of models lead
 naturally to efficient algorithms which can be used to compute solutions having any desired degree of precision;
 and (b) to suggest that such accurate methods (rather than Johansen's method) should be the default when
 solving models (especially applied general equilibrium models) represented in linearized form.},

GTAP-Power database. The model has a relatively simplistic representation of substitution in the electricity sector, but
is useful in demonstrating how specific generating technologies can be used in the conventional GTAP modeling framework.
The representation also implements an alternate form of the constant elasticity of substitution (CES) specification that,
opposed to the traditional CES specification, ensures the sum of inputs (measured in GWh) sums to the total output
(also in GWh). Dixon and Rimmer (2003) implement the alternate specific for labor and Giesecke et al. (2013) implement it for land.
This is the first implementation of the specification for electricity in a standard GTAP model.
In summary, the GTAP-E-Power model leverages the GTAP-Power database and is intended to support electricity-detailed CGE modeling
in the GTAP community.},

This paper develops a model framework and database that incorporates domestic marketing margins on domestic and imported goods going to final demand or used as intermediate inputs, and margins on exports, into the standard GTAP Model. The effects of incorporating domestic marketing activities into an AGE model are illustrated by comparing the results of the standard GTAP Model to the new GTAP-M Model for several different technological change scenarios. The comparison yields two main results. First, tying the domestic marketing activities to specific commodities changes the degree of price transmission from producers to users, compared to a model that does not include margin activities explicitly. The second main result is that the magnitude of the elasticity of substitution between commodities and the composite marketing activity is very important. Allowing variable margins creates a new source of demand-responsiveness for commodities which can significantly alter the results of policy simulations.},

  abstract = {In the future, the land system will be facing new intersecting challenges.
While food demand, especially for resource-intensive livestock based commodities, is expected to
increase, the terrestrial system has large potentials for climate change mitigation through improved
agricultural management, providing biomass for bioenergy, and conserving or even enhancing carbon
stocks of ecosystems. However, uncertainties in future socio-economic land use drivers may result
in very different land-use dynamics and consequences for land-based ecosystem services. This
is the first study with a systematic interpretation of the Shared Socio-Economic Pathways (SSPs)
in terms of possible land-use changes and their consequences for the agricultural system, food
provision and prices as well as greenhouse gas emissions. Therefore, five alternative Integrated Assessment Models
with distinctive land-use modules have been used for the translation of the \{SSP\} narratives into
quantitative projections. The model results reflect the general storylines of the \{SSPs\} and indicate
a broad range of potential land-use futures with global agricultural land of 4900 mio ha in 2005 decreasing
by 810 mio ha until 2100 at the lower (SSP1) and increasing by 1080 mio ha (SSP3) at the upper end.
Greenhouse gas emissions from land use and land use change, as a direct outcome of these diverse land-use dynamics, and
agricultural production systems differ strongly across \{SSPs\} (e.g. cumulative land use change emissions between 2005
and 2100 range from --54 to 402 Gt CO2). The inclusion of land-based mitigation efforts, particularly those in the
most ambitious mitigation scenarios, further broadens the range of potential land futures and can
strongly affect greenhouse gas dynamics and food prices. In general, it can be concluded that low demand
for agricultural commodities, rapid growth in agricultural productivity and globalized trade, all
most pronounced in a \{SSP1\} world, have the potential to enhance the extent of natural ecosystems,
lead to lowest greenhouse gas emissions from the land system and decrease food prices over time. The
SSP-based land use pathways presented in this paper aim at supporting future climate research and
provide the basis for further regional integrated assessments, biodiversity research and climate impact analysis.},

Team research has been much more widespread in the natural sciences than in economics. Yet when it comes to modeling an economy (especially the global economy) in detail, the quantity and range of inputs necessary makes team work the only viable option. Drawing some inspiration from Australian experience, GTAP’s founder, Tom Hertel, realized this from his Project’s inception in 1993. The data base required to model international trade flows could not have been developed without the enthusiastic cooperation of many individuals and institutions around the world. Funding GTAP’s central team at Purdue required external support. National agencies in Australia, Denmark, France, Germany, Holland, Japan, and the US are members of the supporting research consortium. The natural interest of international economic agencies led to GTAP having five such supporting agencies by 1997, which grew to ten by 2006. GTAP has striven to put the maximum feasible amount of its data, methodology and models into the public domain. It has run numerous residential intensive training courses in the use of the GTAP data and model: these have been held in the US, Europe, Africa, Asia and Latin America. The success of these courses reflects the modeling experience of the teams of course instructors and the availability of special-purpose software which allows simulations to be run without programming skill or previous knowledge of the software used. Researchers making use of GTAP have been prolific in number, and in their output. In mid April 2007, applications on the GTAP web site numbered 781. There were 366 subscribers to the GTAP data base at the end of April 2007, but the number of individuals making use of GTAP data exceeded 4,000.},

 Most importantly, history teaches that abnormally rapid growth is rarely persistent, even though economic forecasts
 invariably extrapolate recent growth. Indeed, regression to the mean is the empirically most salient feature of
 economic growth. It is far more robust in the data than, say, the much-discussed middle-income trap. Furthermore, statistical
 analysis of growth reveals that in developing countries, episodes of rapid growth are frequently punctuated by
 discontinuous drop-offs in growth. Such discontinuities account for a large fraction of the variation in growth rates.
 We suggest that salient characteristics of China—high levels of state control and corruption along with high measures of authoritarian
 rule—make a discontinuous decline in growth even more likely than general experience would suggest. China's growth record in the past
 35 years has been remarkable, and nothing in our analysis suggests that a sharp slowdown is inevitable. Still, our analysis suggests
 that forecasters and planners looking at China would do well to contemplate a much wider range of outcomes than are typically considered.},

In terms of the welfare costs of mortality and illnesses associated with outdoor air pollutant emissions, global estimates for 2015 range between \$2.7-3.2 trillion (Coady et al., 2015; OECD, 2016). Still, while greenhouse gas emissions are usually well represented in many global economic databases and models, air pollutant emission accounts in most cases are not included. In particular, this is the case for the widely used Global Trade Analysis Project (GTAP) Data Base and model. In this paper we describe the methodology used to produce a global air pollutant emissions dataset consistent with the GTAP Data Base version 10A. In addition to the non-land use sources, emissions from land use activities are estimated by land cover type, based on the volume of burned biomass and emission factors. The emissions database can be readily incorporated in GTAP-based computable general equilibrium models, enabling assessments of a wide range of policy questions, including the health co-benefits from climate mitigation policies. We illustrate an application of the air pollutant emissions database by tracking changes in primary PM2.5 emissions embodied in trade between 2004 and 2014.},

for analysis linking air pollutant impacts across sectors. In this paper we present methodology and results for air

that describe high, central, and low pollution control ambitions over the 21st century. These narratives are then translated
into quantitative guidance for use in integrated assessment models. The resulting pollutant emission trajectories under the \{SSP\} scenarios cover
a wider range than the scenarios used in previous international climate model comparisons. In the \{SSP3\} and \{SSP4\} scenarios, where economic,
institutional and technological limitations slow air quality improvements, global pollutant emissions over the 21st
century can be comparable to current levels. Pollutant emissions in the \{SSP1\} scenarios fall to low levels due to the
assumption of technological advances and successful global action to control emissions.},

land use, and emissions implications. The \{SSPs\} are part of a new scenario framework, established by the
climate change research community in order to facilitate the integrated analysis of future climate impacts,
vulnerabilities, adaptation, and mitigation. The pathways were developed over the last years as a joint community
effort and describe plausible major global developments that together would lead in the future to different challenges
for mitigation and adaptation to climate change. The \{SSPs\} are based on five narratives describing alternative socio-economic
developments, including sustainable development, regional rivalry, inequality, fossil-fueled development,
and middle-of-the-road development. The long-term demographic and economic projections of the \{SSPs\} depict a
wide uncertainty range consistent with the scenario literature. A multi-model approach was used for the elaboration of
the energy, land-use and the emissions trajectories of SSP-based scenarios. The baseline scenarios lead to
global energy consumption of 400â€“1200 \{EJ\} in 2100, and feature vastly different land-use dynamics, ranging
from a possible reduction in cropland area up to a massive expansion by more than 700 million hectares by 2100.
The associated annual \{CO2\} emissions of the baseline scenarios range from about 25 GtCO2 to more than 120 GtCO2 per year by 2100.
With respect to mitigation, we find that associated costs strongly depend on three factors: (1) the policy
assumptions, (2) the socio-economic narrative, and (3) the stringency of the target. The carbon price for
reaching the target of 2.6 W/m2 that is consistent with a temperature change limit of 2~{\textdegree}C, differs in
our analysis thus by about a factor of three across the \{SSP\} marker scenarios. Moreover, many models could not reach
this target from the \{SSPs\} with high mitigation challenges. While the \{SSPs\} were designed to represent different
mitigation and adaptation challenges, the resulting narratives and quantifications span a wide range of different futures broadly representative
of the current literature. This allows their subsequent use and development in new assessments and research projects.
Critical next steps for the community scenario process will, among others, involve regional and sectoral extensions,
further elaboration of the adaptation and impacts dimension, as well as employing the \{SSP\} scenarios
with the new generation of earth system models as part of the 6th climate model intercomparison project (CMIP6).},

  abstract = {The problem of endowing large applied general equilibrium models with numerical values for parameters is formidable.
 For example, a complete set of own- and cross-price elasticities of demands for the MONASH model of the Australian economy involves in excess of
 50000 items. Invoking the minimal assumptions that demand is generated by utility maximization reduces the load to about 26000---obviously still a
 number much too large for unrestrained econometric estimation. To obtain demand systems estimates for a dozen or so generic commodities at
 a top level of aggregation (categories like 'food', 'clothing and footwear', etc.), typically Johansen's lead has been followed, and directly
 additive preferences imposed upon the underlying utility function. With the move beyond one-step linearized solutions of applied general equilibrium models,
 the functional form of the demand system adopted becomes an issue. The most celebrated of the additive-preference demand systems,
 the linear expenditure system (LES), has one drawback for empirical work; namely, the constancy of marginal budget shares (MBSs)---a liability shared with the Rotterdam system.
 To get around this, Theil and Clements used Holbrook Working's Engel specification in conjunction with additive preferences; unfortunately both Working's
 formulation and Deaton and Muellbauer's AIDS have the problem that, under large changes in real incomes, budget shares can stray outside the [0, 1] interval.
 It was such behaviour that led Cooper and McLaren to devise systems with better regularity properties. These systems, however, are not globally compatible with any
 additive preference system. In this paper we specify, and estimate, at the six-commodity level, an implicitly directly additive-preference demand system
 which allows MBSs to vary as a function of total real expenditure and which is globally regular throughout that part of the the price-expenditure space
 in which the consumer is at least affluent enough to meet subsistence requirements.},

  abstract   = {This article compares the theoretical and functional specification of production in partial equilibrium (PE)
 and computable general equilibrium (CGE) models of the global agricultural and food system included in the AgMIP
 model comparison study. The two model families differ in their scope---partial versus economy-wide---and in how they
 represent technology and the behavior of supply and demand in markets. The CGE models are {"deep"} structural
 models in that they explicitly solve the maximization problem of consumers and producers, assuming utility
 maximization and profit maximization with production/cost functions that include all factor inputs. The PE models
 divide into two groups on the supply side: (1) {"shallow"} structural models, which essentially specify area/yield
 supply functions with no explicit maximization behavior, and (2) {"deep"} structural models that provide a
 detailed activity-analysis specification of technology and explicit optimizing behavior by producers. While the
 models vary in their specifications of technology, both within and between the PE and CGE families, we consider two
 stylized theoretical models to compare the behavior of crop yields and supply functions in CGE models with their
 behavior in shallow structural PE models. We find that the theoretical responsiveness of supply to changes in
 prices can be similar, depending on parameter choices that define the behavior of implicit supply functions over
 the domain of applicability defined by the common scenarios used in the AgMIP comparisons. In practice, however,
 the applied models are more complex and differ in their empirical sensitivity to variations in specification---comparability
 of results given parameter choices is an empirical question. To illustrate the issues, sensitivity analysis is done with
 one global CGE model, MAGNET, to indicate how the results vary with different specification of technical change, and
 how they compare with the results from PE models.},

integrated energy–economy–environment scenarios that keep warming to below 1.5{\textdegree}C by 2100. We find that in such scenarios,
energy-system transformations are in many aspects similar to 2{\textdegree}C-consistent scenarios, but show a faster scale-up of
mitigation action in most sectors, leading to observable differences in emission reductions in 2030 and 2050. The move from a
2{\textdegree}C- to a 1.5{\textdegree}C-consistent world will be achieved mainly through additional reductions of CO2. This implies an earlier transition
to net zero carbon emissions worldwide, to be achieved between 2045 and 2060. Energy efficiency and stringent early reductions
are key to retain a possibility for limiting warming to below 1.5{\textdegree}C by 2100. The window for achieving this goal is small and
rapidly closing.},

the reasons underlying their differences. The most scientifically robust number---the carbon budget
for CO2-induced warming only---is also the least relevant for real-world policy. Including all greenhouse gases
and using methods based on scenarios that avoid instead of exceed a given temperature limit results in
lower carbon budgets. For a >66% chance of limiting warming below the internationally agreed temperature
limit of 2{\textdegree}C relative to pre-industrial levels, the most appropriate carbon budget estimate
is 590-1,240 GtCO2 from 2015 onwards. Variations within this range depend on the probability of
staying below 22{\textdegree}C and on end-of-century non-CO2 warming. Current CO2 emissions are about
40 GtCO2 yr-1, and global CO2 emissions thus have to be reduced urgently to keep within a 2{\textdegree}C-compatible budget},

 for the development of a set of Shared Socioeconomic Pathways ({SSP}s), which are meant to
 differ in terms of their challenges to mitigation and challenges to adaptation. In order for the
 scenario process to fulfill its goals, the research and policy communities need to develop a shared
 understanding of these concepts. This paper focuses on challenges to adaptation. We begin by situating
 this new concept in the context of the rich literatures related to inter alia adaptation,
 vulnerability, and resilience. We argue that a proper characterization of challenges to adaptation
 requires a rich, exploration of the concept, which goes beyond mere description. This has a number of
 implications for the operationalization of the concept in the basic and extended versions of the {SSP}s.
 First, the elements comprising challenges to adaptation must include a wide range of socioeconomic
 and even some (non-climatic) biophysical factors. Second, careful consideration must be given to
 differences in these factors across scales, as well as cross-scale interactions. Third, any representation
 of the concept will require both quantitative and qualitative elements. The scenario framework offers the
 opportunity for the {SSP}s and full scenarios to be of greater value than has been the case in past exercises
 to both Integrated Assessment Modeling ({IAM}) and Impacts, Adaptation, and Vulnerability ({IAV}) researchers,
 but this will require a renegotiation of the traditional, primarily unidirectional relationship between the two communities.},

  abstract   = {BACKGROUND: Whereas the prevalence of hunger and food insecurity is often cited
 as a motivation for reducing losses and waste in agriculture and food systems, the impacts
 of such reduction on food security and the wider economy have not yet been investigated.
 This paper gives insights into these effects, the factors of influence, and derives implications
 for applied research, policy and practice. METHODS: We used economic theory to analyse the impacts
 of food loss reductions on the supply side and food waste reductions on the demand side. The analysis
 is graphical and uses intuitive low-dimension diagrams.RESULTS: The impacts of tackling food losses
 and waste differ from the size of food losses and waste and depend, in addition, on the extent to
 which they are avoidable, factors that cause them to arise (notably food prices) and the costs
 associated with measures to reduce them. Interactions within the food supply chain and the broader
 economy also affect the impacts. Trade-offs occur on the demand side where a reallocation
 of spending on previously wasted foods causes some producers to be worse off and some to be better off.
 Over time, producers tackling losses may have to incur welfare losses in the short run with gains in
 terms of increased revenues, if any, occurring later. Similarly, consumers may delay spending savings
 on previously wasted foods. As a consequence, the impacts, notably on food security and welfare, are ambiguous.

 CONCLUSIONS: Further research should quantify the factors that play a role and carry out economy-wide impact analyses,
 employing a combination of macro, meso and micro-level tools, and presenting a comprehensive set of
 indicators that adequately capture broader societal impacts of tackling food losses and waste.
 This allows policy makers to better target policy and resources, identify complementary policies,
 and move beyond target-setting to addressing the underlying causes, whereby it is important
 to consider the whole food supply chain. Supply chain actors could contribute in terms of
 practical and innovative solutions where they matter most, and feed research and policy makers
 on the bottlenecks that explain why food losses and waste occur, and their relative importance.},

a carbon policy represented by a positive carbon price. Increases in the carbon
price create incentives for production of commercial biomass that affect
the distribution of other land types and, therefore, carbon emissions from
land-use change. Commercial biomass provides a link between the agricultural
and energy systems. The Integrated Assessment of Climate Protection
Strategies (ICLIPS) core model uses AgLU to provide estimates of carbon
emissions from land-use change as one component of total greenhouse gas emissions.
Each major land-use type is assigned an average carbon density used to calculate a
total carbon stock; carbon emissions from land-use change are calculated as the
change in carbon stock between time periods. Significant carbon emissions from
land-use change are present even in the reference scenario. An aggressive
ICLIPS mitigation scenario results in carbon emissions from land-use change up
to 800 million metric tons per year above the AgLU reference scenario.},

  abstract   = {Changes in agricultural land use have important implications for environmental services.
 Previous studies of agricultural land-use futures have been published indicating large uncertainty
 due to different model assumptions and methodologies. In this article we present a first comprehensive
 comparison of global agro-economic models that have harmonized drivers of population, GDP, and biophysical
 yields. The comparison allows us to ask two research questions: (1) How much cropland will be used under
 different socioeconomic and climate change scenarios? (2) How can differences in model results be explained?
 The comparison includes four partial and six general equilibrium models that differ in how they model land
 supply and amount of potentially available land. We analyze results of two different socioeconomic scenarios
 and three climate scenarios (one with constant climate). Most models (7 out of 10) project an increase of
 cropland of 10--25\% by 2050 compared to 2005 (under constant climate), but one model projects a decrease.
 Pasture land expands in some models, which increase the treat on natural vegetation further. Across all
 models most of the cropland expansion takes place in South America and sub-Saharan Africa. In general,
 the strongest differences in model results are related to differences in the costs of land expansion,
 the endogenous productivity responses, and the assumptions about potential cropland.},

 Papers describing the conceptual framework for {SSP}s refer to challenges to mitigation and to adaptation
 as fundamental concepts. Identifying which socioeconomic factors are the most important determinants of
 these challenges, and how to combine them in an internally consistent manner, is critical to scenario
 design. Here we demonstrate a systematic and traceable approach for identifying and prioritizing scenario
 elements. In this study, we identify 13 determinants of mitigation and adaptation challenges at a
 globally aggregated scale based on a survey of 25 experts. In addition, we use 19 expert elicitations
 and a cross-impact balance analysis to create approximately 1.5 million combinations of trends for
 these determinants and rank them in terms of internal consistency. Using the 1,000 most consistent
 combinations, we construct composite metrics for challenges to mitigation and adaptation to uncover
 distinguishable characteristics for five types of SSPs: those with Low, Medium, and High challenges to
 both mitigation and adaptation (consistent with {SSP}s 1-3), and those in which adaptation challenges
 or mitigation challenges dominate (consistent with {SSP}s 4-5). We find a distinguishing characteristic
 for mixed typology {SSP}4 (low mitigation challenges, high adaptation challenges): High trends for innovation
 capacity could lower challenges to mitigation but not necessarily challenges to adaptation. We also find
 that a low trend for quality of governance consistently corresponds to higher challenges to adaptation.
 These findings are suggestive for future research on the {SSP}s in particular, while our analytical approach
 is instructive for scenario development in general.},

 However, little attention is paid to the fact that obesity is becoming an increasing problem
 in developing countries too, with some countries showing increasing rates of obesity in the midst
 of the persisting occurrence of childhood malnutrition and stunting. As developing countries embrace
 the dominant western economic ways of development, industrialization and urbanization they
 contribute to improvements in living standards, with consequent dramatic changes in diets
 and lifestyles leading to weight gain and obesity which in turn poses a growing threat to the health.
 Overweight and obesity is associated with an increased likelihood of non-insulin dependent diabetes mellitus,
 hypertension, hyper-lipidaemia, and cardiovascular disease. It is also associated with increased rates of breast,
 colo-rectal and uterine cancer. Obesity is thus an important factor in the increasing morbidity and mortality due to
 chronic, non-communicable diseases (NCDs) and thereby contributes to premature mortality in the population. Thus,
 while the problem of undernutrition persists in much of the developing world, overweight and obesity and
 its related co-morbidities are posing an increasingly important public health problem both in the developed
 and developing world.},

 from an abstract representation of an economy into realistic models of actual economies.
 Numerical, empirically based general equilibrium models can then be used to evaluate concrete
 policy options by specifying production and demand parameters and incorporating data reflective of real economies.
 Shoven and Whalley describe all aspects of developing applied general equilibrium models,
 including developing an appropriate equilibrium structure, calibrating the model,
 compiling counterfactual equilibria, and interpreting results. The authors contend that the
 Walrasian general equilibrium model provides an ideal framework for appraising the effects of policy changes
 on resource allocation, assessing who gains and who loses, and the policy impacts not well covered by
 empirical macro models. The applications in the book illustrate a number of ways in which fresh
 insights are provided in long standing policy controversies.},

  abstract = {Summary Crop production requires large amounts of green and blue water.
We developed the new global crop water model \{GCWM\} to compute consumptive water use (evapotranspiration) and
virtual water content (evapotranspiration per harvested biomass) of crops at a spatial resolution
of 5\textdegree by 5\textdegree, distinguishing 26 crop classes, and blue versus green water. \{GCWM\} is
based on the global land use data set \{MIRCA2000\} that provides monthly growing areas for
26 crop classes under rainfed and irrigated conditions for the period 1998--2002 and represents multi-cropping.
By computing daily soil water balances, \{GCWM\} determines evapotranspiration of blue and
green water for each crop and grid cell. Cell-specific crop production under both rainfed and irrigated
conditions is computed by downscaling average crop yields reported for 402 national and sub-national statistical
units, relating rainfed and irrigated crop yields reported in census statistics to simulated ratios of
actual to potential crop evapotranspiration for rainfed crops. By restricting water use of irrigated crops to
green water only, the potential production loss without any irrigation was computed. For the period 1998--2002,
the global value of total crop water use was 6685 km3 yr\textsuperscript{-1},
of which blue water use was 1180 km3 yr\textsuperscript{-1}, green water use of irrigated crops was 919 km3 yr\textsuperscript{-1}
and green water use of rainfed crops was 4586 km3 yr\textsuperscript{-1}.
Total crop water use was largest for rice (941 km3 yr\textsuperscript{-1}), wheat (858 km3 yr\textsuperscript{-1})
and maize (722 km3 yr\textsuperscript{-1}). The largest amounts of blue water were used for rice (307 km3 yr\textsuperscript{-1})
and wheat (208 km3 yr\textsuperscript{-1}). Blue water use as percentage of total crop water use was highest
for date palms (85\%), cotton (39\%), citrus fruits (33\%), rice (33\%) and sugar beets (32\%),
while for cassava, oil palm and cocoa, almost no blue water was used. Average crop yield of irrigated cereals
was 442 Mg km\textsuperscript{-2} while average yield of rainfed cereals was only 266 Mg km\textsuperscript{-2}.
Average virtual water content of cereal crops was 1109 m3 Mg\textsuperscript{-1} of green water and 291 m3 Mg\textsuperscript{-1} of blue water,
while average crop water productivity of cereal crops was 714 g m\textsuperscript{-3}.
If currently irrigated crops were not irrigated, global production of dates, rice,
cotton, citrus and sugar cane would decrease by 60\%, 39\%, 38\%, 32\% and 31\%, respectively.
Forty-three per cent of cereal production was on irrigated land,
and without irrigation, cereal production on irrigated land would decrease
by 47\%, corresponding to a 20\% loss of total cereal production. The largest cereal production
losses would occur in Northern Africa (66\%) and Southern Asia (45\%) while losses would be very low for
Northern Europe (0.001\%), Western Europe (1.2\%), Eastern Europe (1.5\%) and Middle Africa (1.6\%).
Uncertainties and limitations are discussed in the manuscript, and a comparison of \{GCWM\}
results to statistics or results of other studies shows good agreement at the regional scale,
but larger differences for specific countries.},

 presents a new model called Nexus Land-Use version 1.0

 of agricultural intensification mechanisms within
 agricultural lands. The Nexus Land-Use model equations
 combine biophysics and economics into a single coherent
 framework to calculate crop yields, food prices, and resulting
 pasture and cropland areas within 12 regions inter-connected
 with each other by international trade. The representation of
 cropland and livestock production systems in each region relies
 on three components: (i) a biomass production function
 derived from the crop yield response function to inputs such
 as industrial fertilisers; (ii) a detailed representation of the
 livestock production system subdivided into an intensive and
 an extensive component, and (iii) a spatially explicit distribution
 of potential (maximal) crop yields prescribed from
 the Lund-Postdam-Jena global vegetation model for managed
 Land (LPJmL). The economic principles governing decisions
 about land-use and intensification are adapted from
 the Ricardian rent theory, assuming cost minimisation for
 farmers. In contrast to the other land-use models linking
 economy and biophysics, crops are aggregated as a representative
 product in calories and intensification for the representative
 crop is a non-linear function of chemical inputs.
 The model equations and parameter values are first described
 in details. Then, idealised scenarios exploring the impact of
 forest preservation policies or rising energy price on agricultural
 intensification are described, and their impacts on pasture
 and cropland areas are investigated.},

 an increase in the value of land. We present a series of models that explain why land prices may have increased.
These models help us understand the increase in both the wealth income ratio and wealth inequality.
 One model focuses on certain locations as being positional good. In another, we show that land bubbles
are a natural part of market economies, and that on "bubble paths", wealth may increase, even as the real wealth of the economy diminishes.

Focusing on long run equilibrium, we show that a tax on the returns on land (including capital gains) can lead to higher incomes and less inequality.

We show the links between the increases in land values and the financial system,
demonstrating how changes in the rules governing that sector and the conduct of monetary policy may increase inequality.

Given the large amount of life cycle savings, the traditional division of society into the owners
of capital and workers or creditors and debtors may no longer provide the most insights for understanding
the impact of policies on distribution. The relevant division is between capitalists, who pass on their
wealth from generation to generation, and workers, and between the owners of equity and the holders of debt instruments.
These distinctions are important for tax, financial and monetary policy. In our simple model, a lowering of
interest rates benefits holders of equity---the capitalists—--but hurts holders of government bonds,
disproportionately life-cycle savers, and thus increases inequality. Similarly, a lowering of collateral requirements
or of banks' capital adequacy requirements does not result in an increase in the overall efficiency of the economy, but leads to more inequality.},

Standard data on savings cannot be reconciled with the increase in the wealth-income ratio:
there is a wealth residual. An important component of this is associated with rents:
land rents, exploitation rents, and returns on intellectual property.

Nor can these stylized facts be reconciled with a standard neoclassical model,
focusing on labor and capital, even taking into account technological change (including skill-biased
technological change), with appropriately defined aggregates.
Explaining why the concepts of "capital" and "wealth" are distinct,
we show that appropriately defined aggregates for wealth may be (and in the case of some countries appear to be)
moving in opposite directions.

We identify some of the factors that may have contributed to the increase
in rents and the divergence between wealth and capital.
Subsequent Parts of this paper will investigate some of these factors in
detail and relate them to changes in inequality.},

identifies the factors that may have contributed to the observed increase in inequality, and provides

Among the key results are: (i) The magnitude of wealth inequality does not, in general depend on
the difference between the rate of interest (r) and the rate of growth (g); the former is
itself an endogenous variable that needs to be explained.
In the standard generalization of the Solow model, in the long run not only is r < g, but sr < g (where s is the savings rate).
(ii) An increase in capital taxation may be (and in some of the central models is) fully shifted, and so may not
lead to lower levels of inequality.
(iii) If the capital tax is progressive and/or the proceeds go to public investment,
wealth inequality may be reduced the well-being of workers may be increased.},

We obtain simple formulae describing the equilibrium fraction of wealth held by life-cycle savers.

Using these formulae, we ascertain the effects of tax policy or changes in the parameters of the economy.
The relative role of life cycle savings increases with the rate of growth and with the relative savings
rate of life-cycle savers and capitalists. An increase in the savings rate of workers has no effect on output per capita;
life cycle savings simply crowds out inherited savings. A tax on capital (even if proceeds are paid out to workers)
is so shifted that capitalists are unaffected and that workers’ income (after transfers) and their share in national wealth are reduced.
If the government invests the proceeds, the share of capital owned by life cycle savers may increase.

We extend the analysis to endogenously derive the distribution of the population between life cycle
savers and capitalists, in a model in which all individuals have identical non-linear savings functions.
When wealth is low enough, bequests drop to zero. With stochastic returns, individuals move between the two groups.

A second extension analyzes the effects of land. We ask whether land holding displaces the holding of capital,
resulting in workers being worse off. A tax on land, while reducing the value of land, leaves unchanged the capital-labor ratio,
output per capita, and wages. But the tax reduces the aggregate value of wealth, and if the proceeds of the tax are
distributed to workers, their income and life cycle savings are increased. On both accounts, wealth inequality is reduced.
Thus, consistent with Henry George’s views, a tax on the returns on land, including capital gains,
reduces inequality with no adverse effect on national income.},

Due to its properties and parsimony in the number of parameters, the CDE functional form offers many potential applications. Two empirical applications are presented. First, aggregate CDE input demand functions are specified and estimated econometrically for the feed concentrate markets in Denmark, Ireland and the United Kingdom. The second empirical application illustrates how a matrix of compensated price elasticities can be obtained with only a priori knowledge of its direct and diagonal elements. The suggested approach exploits some of the properties of the Allen elasticities of substitution associated with the CDE functional form.},

  abstract = {Recently a number of papers have used general equilibrium models to study the economy-wide and environmental consequences of the first generation of biofuels (FGB). In this paper, we argue that nearly all of these studies have overstated the impacts of \{FGB\} on global agricultural and land markets due to the fact that they have ignored the role of biofuel by-products. Feed by-products of FGB, such as dried distillers grains with solubles (DDGS) and oilseed meals (VOBP), are used in the livestock industry as protein and energy sources. Their presence mitigates the price impacts of biofuel production. More importantly, they reduce the demand for cropland and moderate the indirect land use consequences of FGB. This paper explicitly introduces \{DDGS\} and \{VOBP\} into a global computational general equilibrium (CGE) model, developed at the Center for Global Trade Analysis at Purdue University, to examine the economic and environmental impacts of regional and international mandate policies designed to stimulate bioenergy production and use. We show that models with and without by-products reveal different portraits of the economic impacts of the \{US\} and \{EU\} biofuel mandates for the world economy in 2015. While both models demonstrate significant changes in the agricultural production pattern across the world, the model with by-products shows smaller changes in the production of cereal grains and larger changes for oilseeds products in the \{US\} and EU, and the reverse for Brazil. Models that omit by-products are found to overstate cropland conversion from \{US\} and \{EU\} mandates by about 27%.},

In 2001 the global production of biofuels (including ethanol and biodiesel) was about 5 billion gallons. Then the first and second generation of biofuels were introduced into the GTAP data base version 7 for 2004 [2]. In 2004 the global production of all types of first generation of biofuels was about 7.8 billion gallons. In 2004, there was no commercial production of second generation of biofuels (biofuels produced from cellulosic materials).

  abstract   = {Global food demand is increasing rapidly, as are the environmental impacts of agricultural expansion.
 Here, we project global demand for crop production in 2050 and evaluate the environmental impacts of
 alternative ways that this demand might be met. We find that per capita demand for crops, when measured
 as caloric or protein content of all crops combined, has been a similarly increasing function of per
 capita real income since 1960. This relationship forecasts a 100--110\% increase in global crop demand
 from 2005 to 2050. Quantitative assessments show that the environmental impacts of meeting this demand depend
 on how global agriculture expands. If current trends of greater agricultural intensification in richer nations
 and greater land clearing (extensification) in poorer nations were to continue, ~1 billion ha of land would be
 cleared globally by 2050, with {CO2}-C equivalent greenhouse gas emissions reaching ~3 Gt y-1 and N use ~250 Mt y-1 by then.
 In contrast, if 2050 crop demand was met by moderate intensification focused on existing croplands of
 underyielding nations, adaptation and transfer of high-yielding technologies to these croplands,
 and global technological improvements, our analyses forecast land clearing of only ~0.2 billion ha,
 greenhouse gas emissions of ~1 Gt y-1, and global N use of ~225 Mt y-1. Efficient management practices could
 substantially lower nitrogen use. Attainment of high yields on existing croplands of underyielding nations
 is of great importance if global crop demand is to be met with minimal environmental impacts.},

 various countries would slightly reduce GDP at the global level but with mixed effects across countries or regions.
 Significant land re-allocation would take place with notable decreases in forest and pasture lands in a few countries.
 The expansion of biofuels would cause a moderate decrease in world food supply and more significant decreases in
 developing countries like India and Sub-Saharan Africa. Feedstock commodities (sugar, corn and oil seeds) would
 experience significant increases in their prices in 2020, but other price changes are small.},

 climate change requires projecting future food demand. This article reviews demand modeling
 approaches from 10 global economic models participating in the Agricultural Model Intercomparison
 and Improvement Project (AgMIP). We compare food demand projections in 2050 for various regions
 and agricultural products under harmonized scenarios of socioeconomic development, climate change,
 and bioenergy expansion. In the reference scenario (SSP2), food demand increases by 59--98\% between
 2005 and 2050, slightly higher than the most recent FAO projection of 54\% from 2005/2007. The range
 of results is large, in particular for animal calories (between 61\% and 144\%), caused by differences
 in demand systems specifications, and in income and price elasticities. The results are more sensitive
 to socioeconomic assumptions than to climate change or bioenergy scenarios. When considering a world
 with higher population and lower economic growth (SSP3), consumption per capita drops on average by 9\%
 for crops and 18\% for livestock. The maximum effect of climate change on calorie availability is --6\% at
 the global level, and the effect of biofuel production on calorie availability is even smaller.},

 World Bank's World Development Indicators (WDI) database. WDI contains over 1300 time series of socio-economic indicators and provides important
 inputs for the Global Trade Analysis Project (GTAP) Data Base and, as well, can assist in the development of socio-economic scenarios.
 The first application is a stand-alone R application that extracts per capita historical GDP for all countries and summarizes growth episodes
 across regions in a box plot. The two other applications highlight the increasing use of interoperability across software packages to take advantage of the
 specific features of each. The first couples the R-based WDI extraction with a 'Beamer'-type LATEX presentation.
 This is a potentially powerful combination for a quick (and programmatic) turnaround from data to presentation.
 With little effort, the application can be extended to generate a large number of slides.
 The second example of interoperability is centered on a General Algebraic Modeling System (GAMS) program that calls R as a
 sub-process to extract the data for further processing in GAMS. The R-script developed for this last application could be readily
 coupled with other software packages.},

  abstract    = {This paper provides the complete specification of the {LINKAGE} Model. The latest version of the
 model is based on Version 7.1 of the GTAP dataset and has been used to assess global free trade in the context of a
 future round of multilateral trade negotiations (see the World Bank's Global Economic Prospects 2002 and Global
 Economic Prospects 2004), the multilateral negotiations under the aegis of the Doha Development Agenda (Laborde et al 2011)
 and international migration (World Bank 2006).

 The LINKAGE Model is a global dynamic computable general equilibrium model (CGE) with a 2004 base year. In its
 standard version, it is a neo-classical model with both factor and goods market clearing. It features three production
 archetypes---crops, livestock, and other-, a full range of tax instruments, price markups, multiple labor skills,
 vintage capital, and energy as an input combined with capital. Trade is modeled using nested Armington and production
 transformation structures to determine bilateral trade flows. Tariffs are fully bilateral and the model captures international
 trade and transportation costs---both direct and indirect (using iceberg trade costs). The current version of the model
 also implements tariff rate quotas (TRQs). A recursive framework is used to drive dynamics, with savings-led investment and
 productivity. The model incorporates adjustment costs in capital markets and trade-responsive endogenous productivity.

 The core of the paper is divided into five sections---an introduction, a model overview, a detailed description of each
 block of the model, a discussion of model dynamics, and a description of the accounting framework underlying the model.},

 scenario assesses the growth of greenhouse gas emissions and the ensuing impacts on the climate.
 Under the baseline scenario, Asia's high growth leads to a strong rotation in global output and emissions by the
 year 2050. The analytical framework traces back the changes in temperature to economic damages---limited to
 the agricultural sectors. Parts of Asia are likely to see much higher dependence on food imports as a
 consequence of these damages. Various carbon tax scenarios are implemented to assess the potential for reducing
 carbon emissions. Because of the structure of their economies, Asian countries are likely to bear the
 greatest burden in reducing emissions in an efficient global tax scheme, but there is significant scope
 to ease this burden through financial transfers.},

 expansion of resource-based sectors, partly because of access to cheaper energy. {NAFTA} integration is environmentally

 across spatial scales, and (ii) adding indicators of importance for projecting vulnerability. The paper

 studies has been published that include scenario projections. Comparison of these

 Mapping these scenario families allow a simpler comparison across the different assessments.
 The fact that many assessments can be positioned within these families gives some
 confidence of their relevance. It is also noticeable that several recent assessments
 have been focusing on more focussed policy-scenarios as variant to a single baseline.
 This is partly a response to a different stage in the policy-making process. While there
 are clear advantages of both categories of scenarios (explorative scenarios and baseline/policy variants),
 it might be important to test the robustness of scenario outcomes of the policy-scenario approach
 against the different storyline scenario-families identified in this paper.},

 of future global development (described as shared socio-economic pathways). The matrix can be used to guide scenario
 development at different scales. It can also be used as a heuristic tool for classifying new and existing scenarios
 for assessment. Key elements of the architecture, in particular the shared socio-economic pathways and shared
 policy assumptions (devices for incorporating explicit mitigation and adaptation policies), are elaborated

of the \{SSPs\} (SSP2 and SSP3) and b) the \{SSP1\} implementation of other integrated assessment models.
The results show that a combination of resource efficiency, preferences for sustainable production methods and investment in human development
could lead to a strong transition towards a more renewable energy supply, less land use and lower anthropogenic greenhouse gas
emissions in 2100 than in 2010, even in the absence of explicit climate policies. At the same time, climate policy
would still be needed to reduce emissions further, in order to reduce the projected increase of global mean temperature from 3~{\textdegree}C
(SSP1 reference scenario) to 2 or 1.5~{\textdegree}C (in line with current policy targets). The \{SSP1\} storyline could be a
basis for further discussions on how climate policy can be combined with achieving other societal goals.},

 equivalent (MtCO(2)e) in 2008. Agricultural production, including
 indirect emissions associated with land-cover change, contributes
 80\%-86\% of total food system emissions, with significant regional
 variation. The impacts of global climate change on food systems are
 expected to be widespread, complex, geographically and temporally
 variable, and profoundly influenced by socioeconomic conditions.
 Historical statistical studies and integrated assessment models provide
 evidence that climate change will affect agricultural yields and
 earnings, food prices, reliability of delivery, food quality, and,
 notably, food safety. Low-income producers and consumers of food will be
 more vulnerable to climate change owing to their comparatively limited
 ability to invest in adaptive institutions and technologies under
 increasing climatic risks. Some synergies among food security,
 adaptation, and mitigation are feasible. But promising interventions,
 such as agricultural intensification or reductions in waste, will
 require careful management to distribute costs and benefits effectively.}},

  abstract   = {Recent studies assessing plausible futures for agricultural markets and global food security
 have had contradictory outcomes. To advance our understanding of the sources of the differences, 10 global
 economic models that produce long-term scenarios were asked to compare a reference scenario with alternate
 socioeconomic, climate change, and bioenergy scenarios using a common set of key drivers. Several key
 conclusions emerge from this exercise: First, for a comparison of scenario results to be meaningful, a careful
 analysis of the interpretation of the relevant model variables is essential. For instance, the use of {"real
 world commodity prices"} differs widely across models, and comparing the prices without accounting for their
 different meanings can lead to misleading results. Second, results suggest that, once some key assumptions are
 harmonized, the variability in general trends across models declines but remains important. For example, given
 the common assumptions of the reference scenario, models show average annual rates of changes of real global
 producer prices for agricultural products on average ranging between -0.4\% and +0.7\% between the 2005 base
 year and 2050. This compares to an average decline of real agricultural prices of 4\% p.a. between the 1960s
 and the 2000s. Several other common trends are shown, for example, relating to key global growth areas for
 agricultural production and consumption. Third, differences in basic model parameters such as income and
 price elasticities, sometimes hidden in the way market behavior is modeled, result in significant differences
 in the details. Fourth, the analysis shows that agro-economic modelers aiming to inform the agricultural
 and development policy debate require better data and analysis on both economic behavior and biophysical
 drivers. More interdisciplinary modeling efforts are required to cross-fertilize analyses at different scales.},

  abstract    = {Since China's application in 1987 to resume its status in the Generalized Agreement on Trade and Tariffs
(GATT)/World Trade Organization (WTO) there has been a great deal of debate over the timing of China's
accession. Although most of the issues relating to the timing of China's trade liberalization have been resolved, the
abolition of restrictions on Chinese textiles and clothing may still be subject to delay if
the United States and Europe choose to implement the safeguards contained in the their bilateral accession agreements with
China as well as in the original Agreement on Textiles and Clothing (ATC).

In this paper, the effects of alternative target dates for the elimination of restrictions on textiles quotas
are examined. Since this issue revolves fundamentally around the question of timing, it is most appropriately addressed
in a dynamic model. In this study we use the Dynamic GTAP model. This is applied to a 19-region by 22-commodity aggregation
of the GTAP database, supplemented with foreign income data.

The paper finds that timing is indeed an important determinant of the profile of structural adjustment required in
China and the rest of the world. In light of their interest in delayed implementation the ATC,
it is interesting to note that our results suggest slower elimination of these quotas is detrimental to national welfare
in North America and Europe.},

  abstract    = {The GTAP standard model has proved a useful analysis tool and data source for over 20 years.
The GTAP model has been updated overtime, but it maintains the structure of a single regional household,
with income distributed into three components: government, private and savings-investment expenditures. There has been a need
for a more detailed accounting system, especially as it relates to estimating the potential impacts of policies and
global shocks on poverty, sustainable and inclusive growth.

This paper presents an extension to the GTAP model and its accounting framework to
implement distinct and multiple households, split factors of production, foreign aid and remittances, government
and household transfer. The model and associated accounting links a household's expenditure to factor incomes (through ownership shares) and
taxes. Government expenditure is linked to taxes and foreign aid. The MyGTAP model provides the user more
flexibility in: the treatment of government and household savings and spending; the selection of a linear
expenditure systems (LES) or a constant difference of elasticities (CDE) demand function\s. The model is incorporated
into a RunGTAP application which supports many of RunGTAP's popular programs such as alter-tax, GTAPview and others.
The introduction of a split regional household (which does not require splitting data for every region)
supports economic analysis based on detailed households, government, factor income, remittances, foreign aid and income transfers. The
code can be modified to include multiple regions with unique household structures.

This paper documents the model and accounting framework for the use of data output from the MyGTAP
data splitting program. It is intended to be used in tandem with a complimentary paper and programs found
in:"MyGTAP Data Program: A Program for Customizing and Extending the GTAP Database", GTAP Working Paper No. 79, by Minor, Peter and Terrie Wamsley 2013.},

Examples include the role of international remittances (Harrison et al, 2003) or those immigrant-links underpinning the migration-trade nexus (Gould, 1994). More recently Walmsley and Winters (2005) utilised a Global Migration model (GMig) to demonstrate that lifting restrictions on the movement of natural persons would significantly increase global welfare with the majority of benefits accruing to developing countries. Although an important result, the lack of bilateral labor migration data forced Walmsley and Winters (2005) to make approximations in important areas and naturally precluded their tracking bilateral migration agreements. In a new technical paper, Walmsley, Winters, and Ahmed incorporate bilateral labor flows into the GMig model developed by Walmsley and Winters (2005) to examine the impact of liberalizing the temporary movement of natural persons. Quotas on both skilled and unskilled temporary labor in the developed economies are increased by 3% of their labor forces. This additional labor is supplied by the developing economies. The results confirm that restrictions on the movement of natural persons impose significant costs on nearly all countries, and that those on unskilled labor are more burdensome than those on skilled labor. Developed economies increasing their skilled and unskilled labor forces by 3% raise the real incomes of their permanent residents. Most of those gains arise from the lifting of quotas on unskilled labor. On average the permanent residents of developing countries also gain in terms of real incomes from sending unskilled and skilled labor, albeit the gains are lower for skilled labor. While results differ across developing economies, most gain as a result of the higher remittances sent home.},

  abstract = {Previous studies have combined climate, crop and economic models to examine the impact of climate change on agricultural
 production and food security, but results have varied widely due to differences in models, scenarios and input data.
 Recent work has examined (and narrowed) these differences through systematic model intercomparison using a high-emissions
 pathway to highlight the differences. This paper extends that analysis to explore a range of plausible socioeconomic scenarios and
 emission pathways. Results from multiple climate and economic models are combined to examine the global and regional impacts of
 climate change on agricultural yields, area, production, consumption, prices and trade for coarse grains, rice, wheat, oilseeds and
 sugar crops to 2050. We find that climate impacts on global average yields, area, production and consumption are similar
 across shared socioeconomic pathways ({SSP} 1, 2 and 3, as we implement them based on population, income and productivity drivers),
 except when changes in trade policies are included. Impacts on trade and prices are higher for {SSP} 3 than {SSP} 2, and higher for {SSP} 2
 than for {SSP} 1. Climate impacts for all variables are similar across low to moderate emissions pathways ({RCP} 4.5 and {RCP} 6.0),
 but increase for a higher emissions pathway ({RCP} 8.5). It is important to note that these global averages may hide regional variations.
 Projected reductions in agricultural yields due to climate change by 2050 are larger for some crops than those estimated for the
 past half century, but smaller than projected increases to 2050 due to rising demand and intrinsic productivity growth.
 Results illustrate the sensitivity of climate change impacts to differences in socioeconomic and emissions pathways.
 Yield impacts increase at high emissions levels and vary with changes in population, income and technology, but are reduced
 in all cases by endogenous changes in prices and other variables.},

strong VS for China. Using the 'ordinary' I--O tables, however, this is not the
case. Because the production of processing exports is only a small part of total production,
the average input structure in the I--O table hides the typical features of processing
exports. Using adapted, tripartite I--O tables (for 2002 and 2007) in
which the processing exports have been singled out, indeed reveals the expected strong VS in China.},

  abstract  = {The way poverty is measured is important for an understanding of what has happened to poverty as well as for anti-poverty policy
 evaluation. Sen's (1976) pathfinding work has motivated many researchers to focus on the way poverty should be measured. A poverty measure,
 argued by Sen, should satisfy certain properties or axioms and the desirability of a poverty measure should be evaluated by these axioms.
 During the last two decades, many researchers have adopted the axiomatic approach pioneered by Sen to propose additional axioms and
 develop alternative poverty measures. The objective of this survey is to provide a clarification on the extensive literature of aggregate poverty measures.
 In this survey, we first examine the desirability of each axiom, the properties of each poverty measure, and the interrelationships among axioms.
 The desirability of an axiom cannot be evaluated in isolation, and some combination of axioms may make it impossible to devise a satisfactory poverty measure;
 some axioms can be implied by other axioms combined and so are not independent; some others are ad hoc and are disqualified as axioms for poverty measurement.
 Based on the interactions among axioms, we identify the 'core' axioms which together have a strong implication on the functional form of a poverty measure.
 We then review poverty measures that have appeared in the literature, evaluating the interrelationships among different measures,
 and examining the properties of each measure. The axioms each measure satisfies/violates are also summarized in a tabular form.
 Several 'good' poverty measures, which have not been documented by previous surveys, are also included.},

 This paper adopts an axiomatic approach and complements the Watts index with such a characterization. Under a set of reasonable axioms,
 the Watts index is the unique index if a poverty index is perceived as the absolute amount of social welfare loss due to poverty.
 The Watts index is relatively easy to apply. It also satisfies all basic axioms for a good poverty index.},

  abstract = {Long-term food demand scenarios are an important tool for studying global food security and
 for analysing the environmental impacts of agriculture. We provide a simple and transparent method
 to create scenarios for future plant-based and animal-based calorie demand, using time-dependent regression
 models between calorie demand and income. The scenarios can be customized to a specific storyline by
 using different input data for gross domestic product (GDP) and population projections and by assuming different
 functional forms of the regressions. Our results confirm that total calorie demand increases with income,
 but we also found a non-income related positive time-trend. The share of animal-based calories is estimated to
 rise strongly with income for low-income groups. For high income groups, two ambiguous relations between income
 and the share of animal-based products are consistent with historical data: First, a positive relation with a strong
 negative time-trend and second a negative relation with a slight negative time-trend. The fits of our regressions
 are highly significant and our results compare well to other food demand estimates. The method is exemplarily used
 to construct four food demand scenarios until the year 2100 based on the storylines of the {IPCC} Special Report on Emissions Scenarios ({SRES}).
 We find in all scenarios a strong increase of global food demand until 2050 with an increasing share of animal-based products,
 especially in developing countries.},

This industry cost function is dual to a well-behaved constant returns to scale production function, the large output or asymptotic production function.

(An Implicit, Directly Additive Demand System), offers an approach

the LES, AIDADS includes subsistence parameters that define minimum
consumption levels. Here we present a modified AIDADS (MAIDADS)
that replaces the constant subsistence parameters with
functions that also vary with utility; these transformed subsistence levels
are referred to as minimum consumption quantities. This
model is applied to the 1996 International Consumption Project data.
As these data span a wide range of expenditure levels, MAIDADS offers a viable alternative for the estimation of a �global demand system�. Results suggest minimum consumption quantities for staple grains, livestock, other food products, alcohol and tobacco, clothing and footwear and transport and transport services vary with expenditure, while those for rent and fuel and household furnishings and operations are zero and invariant across expenditure levels. Only the minimum consumption quantity for staple grains declines with expenditure.},

in which producer and consumer decisions are both intra- and intertemporally consistent.
Consumers maximize the present value of the utility of consumption; producers maximize the present value of profits.
The model solves for the set of intertemporally consistent prices. The parsimonious structure of
the model is achieved by dividing the economy into two producing sectors---exports and domestic goods---and two consumed goods---imports and domestic goods.
As a result, there is only one endogenous price per period to be solved for (the price of the domestic good),
although "structural" questions, such as the evolution of the real exchange rate, can be posed with the model.
Furthermore, with this structural breakdown, the model can be calibrated with national accounts data only.
In the paper, we show how to calibrate such a model (including specification of an adjustment-cost function,
to avoid "bang-bang" behavior) and use the model to examine various questions where intertemporal issues are important,
including terms-of-trade shocks and tariff reform.},

Several major international organizations have attempted to quantify global energy subsidies and provide assessment of their potential reform. This includes studies by Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), International Energy Agency (IEA) and International Monetary Fund (IMF). While most of these contributions provide estimates of wide economic effects they lack consistent assessment of environmental co-benefits of subsidies elimination, which can potentially have a significant influence on aggregate results and their regional distribution.
In this paper, we apply a multistep framework to analyze two global energy subsidies scenarios, which include elimination of pre-tax consumer and post-tax local pollution subsidies. Computable general equilibrium GTAP-E-Power model is used to implement energy subsidy policies, quantify economic impacts, estimate energy use changes and CO2 emissions. Energy use changes are linked to emissions of air pollutants (SO2, NOx and PM2.5) and pollution-mortality impacts are estimated based on the population exposed by pollution and corresponding mortality risks for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, lung cancer, ischemic heart disease and stroke. Finally, welfare benefits related to reduced mortality rates using country-adjusted willingness-to-pay measure from direct valuation studies.},

  abstract    = {The constant elasticity of transformation (CET) functional form has been widely used in CGE models for handling land heterogeneity. However, the CET approach cannot provide traceable land use change results since land productivity changes due to land transformation are implicitly adjusted by shifting effective land supply so that results are �effective land� rather than physical land. In this study, we proposed a framework in which land transformation is physically modeled using the additive CET (ACET) approach while land productivity changes due to transformation are adjusted from land demand in production. We decomposed land productivity changes technical shifters using ACET. We demonstrated that implementing a same land productivity change technical shifter from either land supply side or land demand side are equivalent in non-land market equilibrium. For the purpose of this study, we build a simple CGE model and design experiments to comparing CET with ACET and to testing the sensitivity of two new margin responses including land productivity response due to transformation and the multiple cropping and unused land response. We demonstrated that the ACET approach plus the land productivity adjustments provide a promising alternative to the CET approach in modeling land supply in CGE model, despite that more careful studies are necessary for calibrating parameters for important responses.},

We compare the layout of different well-known global and single country CGE models and discuss to what extent our flexible framework can replicate these features. In a structural sensitivity analysis, we compare major results of test shocks (multi-lateral trade liberalization and endowment changes in one country) by our framework under different configuration. These reflect important structural differences between the chosen examples as well as additional features such as the Melitz model or endogenous capital stocks driven by investments in a comparative-static setting. We find relative limited differences between models based on the Armington assumption, even if other features differ such as closures, the production function nesting, allowing for substitution on different nodes of the nest, for sluggish factor supply between agricultural and non-agricultural sectors and other elements such as the functional form in demand. A discussion on further joint development of such a framework leads to our summary and conclusions.},

On a substantive level, commodities and activities are separated, allowing for multi-product sectors, as well as multiple sectors
producing the same commodity. Additional flexibility is provided for modeling of production and consumption behavior, and the
valuation and naming conventions have been modified. In addition, this paper folds in important advances since the 1997 publication,
including the revised treatment of non-homotheticity in final demand, the welfare decomposition and multi-modal international
transportation. The paper opens with an overview which puts this widely used model in broader context. The model exposition
is comprehensive and includes a bridging table linking the original, "classic" model with the current version. This is followed
by a section discussing the major extensions of the standard model and how they are being used. The paper closes with an
overall assessment and a discussion of future research directions.},

from offline to online shopping---and a change in policy---measures to reduce the
barriers to online trade perceived by consumers and retailers. Contrary to the prevalent
micro-economic partial equilibrium consumer modelling approach to e-commerce, we
use a macro-economic general equilibrium model that brings together the impact on
consumers as well as on producers. We use survey data on cross-border e-commerce
between EU Member States to estimate the implied cross-border trade cost reduction
when consumers move from offline to online consumption as well as the implied costs of
perceived regulatory barriers to e-commerce. We distinguish between cross-border and
domestic trade costs effects. We find that cross-bordere-commerce reduces trade costs
compared to offline trade. Increased price competition squeezes domestic retail price
margins and has a negative output effect in that sector (-2.6\%). However, the resulting
retail efficiency gains have a positive effect on production in other sectors (between 0.9
and 2.6\%) and on household consumption (+1.07\%). The combined macro-economic
effect of these transmission channels adds 0.14\% to EU GDP. Additional policy measures
to facilitate cross-border e-commerce between EU Member States could add another
0.3\% to household consumption and 0.04\% to GDP, or 0.03\% in the more conservative
estimate. The relatively weak GDP effect in comparison with the production and
consumption effects indicates that the shift from offline to online retail induces
considerable welfare redistribution from retailing to other sectors and to households,
more so than a production effect.},

  abstract  = {The Doha Round faced a long series of launch-delays and a spectacular launch-failure in Seattle in 1999. While the talks did take off in 2001, the negotiating agenda is still ambiguous in a number of crucial areas. This paper argues that these ambiguities matter greatly. Such ambiguities include the meaning of 'flexibility and exemptions', which are part of the evolving framework for market access negotiations. This may (or may not) be read as allowing developing countries to opt for much smaller concessions than those to be undertaken by the OECD, or even for no concessions. To explore these issues, we examine the impact of multilateral liberalization, developing possible trade liberalization under the Doha Round, starting from a realistic 'baseline' including Chinese WTO Accession and the 2004 EU enlargement. This allows us to focus on effects specifically attributable to trade liberalization under the Doha Round and the potential impact of the Doha Round itself. To this end we employ a global applied general equilibrium model, featuring imperfect competition and variety effects. Scenarios include agriculture, manufactures, and services liberalization, as well as trade facilitation. We conclude that active developing country participation in terms of market access concessions is critical to their prospects. If developing countries continue for the most part with business as usual after the round, in terms of trade policy, there is little scope for actual benefits accruing to developing countries. South-South trade liberalization is key to the 'development' part of the Doha Development Agenda.},

We show that estimated gravity equations do not have a theoretical foundation. This implies both that estimation suffers from omitted variables bias and that comparative statics analysis is unfounded. We develop a method that (i) consistently and efficiently estimates a theoretical gravity equation and (ii) correctly calculates the comparative statics of trade frictions. We apply the method to solve the famous McCallum border puzzle. Applying our method, we find that national borders reduce trade between industrialized countries by moderate amounts of 20-50 percent.},

The model combines matrices of carbon fluxes (Mg CO2/ha/y) with matrices of changes in land use (ha) according to land-use category as projected by GTAP or similar AEZ-oriented models. As published, AEZ-EF aggregates the carbon flows to the same 19 regions and 18 AEZs used by GTAP-BIO, the version of GTAP currently used by Purdue University researchers for modeling biofuel-induced ("indirect") land-use change (ILUC) (e.g., Tyner, Taheripour et al. 2010). The AEZ-EF model, however, is designed to work with an arbitrary number of regions, as described in the accompanying report.},

The regional bloc��s integration programme is envisaged to be taken further through the formation of a customs union via a common external tariff (CET) planned to be in place by end of 2004.
This study provides a quantitative assessment using the GTAP model of the likely implications of the implementation of the COMESA Treaty to establish the FTA and then form a customs union through the CET.  The focus of the analysis is on the implications of the accompanying trade liberalisation on macroeconomic aggregates including those that have a bearing on poverty reduction; industry structure; welfare; and the trade diversion versus trade creation question.},

We base our estimations of the value of each service on projections of losses that would accrue if insects were not functioning at their current level.

  abstract = {Although emissions of CO$_2$ are the largest anthropogenic contributor to the risks of climate change, other substances are important
in the formulation of a cost-effective response. To provide improved facilities for addressing their role, we develop an
approach for endogenizing control of these other greenhouse gases within a computable general equilibrium (CGE) model of
the world economy. The calculation is consistent with underlying economic production theory. For parameterization it is able
to draw on marginal abatement cost (MAC) functions for these gases based on detailed technological descriptions of control options. We
apply the method to the gases identified in the Kyoto Protocol: methane (CH$_4$), nitrous oxide (N$_2$O), sulfur hexaflouride (SF$_6$),
the perflourocarbons (PFCs), and the hydrofluorocarbons (HFCs). Complete and consistent estimates are provided
of the costs of meeting greenhouse-gas reduction targets with a focus on "what" flexibility --- i.e., the ability to
abate the most cost-effective mix of gases in any period. We find that non-CO$_2$ gases
are a crucial component of a cost-effective policy. Because of their high GWPs under current international agreements
they would contribute a substantial share of early abatement.},

The GTAP LULC database and its variants have been extensively used in a wide variety of applications aimed at examining the land-environment-energy nexus. Looking back the development of the first GTAP LULC was no simple task as it required the expertise of several researchers to identify and process relevant geospatial information. And because of this, succeeding updates of the GTAP LULC database (namely v.7 for 2004 and v.8 for 2004, 2007) relied heavily on AEZ-region level data from GTAP LULCv.6 in order to update land cover and land use as well as share-out land rents.

This memorandum documents the development of the GTAP LULC v.9 database. In keeping with the multi-year release of GTAP v.9, the GTAP LULC v.9 data is developed for each benchmark year (i.e. 2004, 2007 and 2011). But unlike previous releases, GTAP LULCv.9 is created directly from publicly available high-resolution (i.e. 5-minute grid) spatial land cover and land use maps. Since these maps can be readily downloaded online, it is possible to replicate GTAP LULCv.9 if users know how to handle spatial data and if they follow the methods outlined in this document. Furthermore, by developing the capacity to handle spatial data within the Center, new spatial LULC information can be easily incorporated in future releases of the GTAP LULC.},

Using linked economic and terrestrial biogeochemistry models, we examined direct and indirect effects of possible land-use changes from an expanded global cellulosic bioenergy program on greenhouse gas emissions over the 21st century. Our model predicts that indirect land use will be responsible for substantially more carbon loss (up to twice as much) than direct land use; however, because of predicted increases in fertilizer use, nitrous oxide emissions will be more important than carbon losses themselves in terms of warming potential. A global greenhouse gas emissions policy that protects forests and encourages best practices for nitrogen fertilizer use can dramatically reduce emissions associated with biofuels production.},

Using an integrated global system model, we explore the roles that these land-use options can play in a global mitigation strategy to stabilize Earth's average temperature within 2 ...C of the preindustrial level and their impacts on agriculture. We show that an ambitious global Energy-Only climate policy that includes biofuels would likely not achieve the 2 ...C target. A thought-experiment where the world ideally prices land carbon fluxes combined with biofuels (Energy+Land policy) gets the world much closer. Land could become a large net carbon sink of about 178 Pg C over the 21st century with price incentives in the Energy+Land scenario. With land carbon pricing but without biofuels (a No-Biofuel scenario) the carbon sink is nearly identical to the case with biofuels, but emissions from energy are somewhat higher, thereby results in more warming. Absent such incentives, land is either a much smaller net carbon sink (+37 Pg C - Energy-Only policy) or a net source (-21 Pg C - No-Policy). The significant trade-off with this integrated land-use approach is that prices for agricultural products rise substantially because of mitigation costs borne by the sector and higher land prices. Share of income spent on food for wealthier regions continues to fall, but for the poorest regions, higher food prices lead to a rising share of income spent on food.

By including linkages between production-based emissions in one country and final consumption in another (via cross-border value chains), we focus on the entire carbon chain. We estimate polynomial and threshold models, accounting for reverse causality and identification problems. We find that the income-elasticity for both inventories is regime-dependent and reflects small carbon efficiency gains from economic development. Carbon footprints show larger income-elasticities, while national policy instruments targeting production can clearly be circumvented by carbon embodied in intermediate trade. This implies problems of environmental sustainability that may require consumption-based policy instruments.},

The theory underlying our model is consistent with Melitz (2003). A nonlinear structural estimation procedure identifies a set of core parameters and unobserved firm-level trade frictions that best fit the geographic pattern of trade. Our estimation model is consistent with the specified general equilibrium model, and we conduct general equilibrium counterfactual analyses to illustrate model responses. We first assess the economic effects of reductions in measured tariffs. Taking the simple-average welfare change across regions the Melitz structure indicates welfare gains from liberalization that are four times larger than in a standard trade policy simulation. Furthermore, when we compare the economic impact of tariff reductions with reductions in estimated fixed trade costs we find that policy measures affecting the fixed costs are of greater importance than tariff barriers.},

This research memorandum describes the empirically based calibration strategy used to determine the CET value for the land cover allocation nest dealing with the broader three commercial uses, and examines how land use responsiveness and the parameter value evolve over time. The calibration is accomplished using the GTAP Land Use Database and time paths of land quantities by use over a 100 year period. These land quantity projections are, in turn, based on matrices of land use transition probabilities and own return elasticities of transition probabilities for the USA. We find that over time there is a rise in the land use response to increases in own-returns and in own return elasticities, while there is a fall in the calibrated CET value. The value of the CET parameter decreases at a decreasing rate every five-year period, although it can be approximated by a linear relationship in the short to medium run. We can use this linear interpolation to estimate the average CET parameter associated with any desired length of run.},

We show that, while some deforestation is optimal in the near term, the desirability of further deforestation is elimated by mid-century under the baseline scenario. While the adverse productivity shocks from climate change have a modest effect on global land use, when combined with high growth in energy prices they lead to significant deforestation and higher GHG emissions than in the baseline. Imposition of GHG emissions constraint further heightens the competition for land, as fertilizer use declines and land-based mitigation strategies expand. However, the effectiveness of such a pre-announced constraint is completely diluted by intertemporal substitution of deforestation which accelerates prior to imposition of the target.},

The model seeks to determine the optimal allocation of scarce land across competing uses across time. FABLE integrates distinct strands of agronomic, economic and biophysical literatures into a single, intertemporally consistent, analytical framework, at global scale. It is based on a dynamic long-run, forward-looking partial equilibrium framework, in which the societal objective function places value on food production, liquid fuels (including first- and second- generation biofuels), timber production, forest carbon and biodiversity. The forestry sector is characterized by multiple forest vintages, which add considerable computational complexity in the context of this dynamic forward-looking analysis. Our baseline accurately reflects developments in global land use over the years that have already transpired, and determines the optimal path of global land use over the course of next century based on projections of population, income and demand growth from a variety of recognized sources.},

I use this trade data by end use to expand the GTAP Database version 9.2, thus incorporating direct linkages from foreign suppliers to domestic producers, investors, and consumers. Further, the new database comprises distinct composite tariff rates for producers, investors, and consumers. I use a constrained optimization procedure to ensure MRIO trade flows aggregate to the original GTAP Database. Through illustrative simulations, I demonstrate the effect of (1) new cross-border trade linkages and (2) tariff escalation for trade policy analysis. I further demonstrate how the addition of differentiated tariffs in the MRIO enhances policy analysis beyond preceding versions of the MRIO.},

  abstract = {In this article, we evaluate and compare results from three integrated assessment models (GCAM, IMAGE, and ReMIND/MAgPIE) regarding the drivers and impacts of bioenergy production on the global land system. The considered model frameworks employ linked energy, economy, climate and land use modules. By the help of these linkages the direct competition of bioenergy with other energy technology options for greenhouse gas (GHG) mitigation, based on economic costs and GHG emissions from bioenergy production, has been taken into account. Our results indicate that dedicated bioenergy crops and biomass residues form a potentially important and cost-effective input into the energy system. At the same time, however, the results differ strongly in terms of deployment rates, feedstock composition and land-use and greenhouse gas implications. The current paper adds to earlier work by specific looking into model differences with respect to the land-use component that could contribute to the noted differences in results, including land cover allocation, land use constraints, energy crop yields, and non-bioenergy land mitigation options modeled. In scenarios without climate change mitigation, bioenergy cropland represents 10--18�{\%} of total cropland by 2100 across the different models, and boosts cropland expansion at the expense of carbon richer ecosystems. Therefore, associated emissions from land-use change and agricultural intensification as a result of bio-energy use range from 14 and 113 Gt CO2-eq cumulatively through 2100. Under climate policy, bioenergy cropland increases to 24--36�{\%} of total cropland by 2100.},

  abstract = {Systematic model inter-comparison helps to narrow discrepancies in the analysis of the future impact of climate change on agricultural production. This paper presents a set of alternative scenarios by five global climate and agro-economic models. Covering integrated assessment (IMAGE), partial equilibrium (CAPRI, GLOBIOM, MAgPIE) and computable general equilibrium (MAGNET) models ensures a good coverage of biophysical and economic agricultural features. These models are harmonized with respect to basic model drivers, to assess the range of potential impacts of climate change on the agricultural sector by 2050. Moreover, they quantify the economic consequences of stringent global emission mitigation efforts, such as non-CO 2 emission taxes and land-based mitigation options, to stabilize global warming at 2 �C by the end of the century under different Shared Socioeconomic Pathways. A key contribution of the paper is a vis-�-vis comparison of climate change impacts relative to the impact of mitigation measures. In addition, our scenario design allows assessing the impact of the residual climate change on the mitigation challenge. From a global perspective, the impact of climate change on agricultural production by mid-century is negative but small. A larger negative effect on agricultural production, most pronounced for ruminant meat production, is observed when emission mitigation measures compliant with a 2 �C target are put in place. Our results indicate that a mitigation strategy that embeds residual climate change effects (RCP2.6) has a negative impact on global agricultural production relative to a no-mitigation strategy with stronger climate impacts (RCP6.0). However, this is partially due to the limited impact of the climate change scenarios by 2050. The magnitude of price changes is different amongst models due to methodological differences. Further research to achieve a better harmonization is needed, especially regarding endogenous food and feed demand, including substitution across individual commodities, and endogenous technological change.},

  abstract = {Summary
Background
Slowing climate change is crucial to the future wellbeing of human societies and the greater environment. Current beef production systems in the USA are a major source of negative environmental impacts and raise various animal welfare concerns. Nevertheless, beef production provides a food source high in protein and many nutrients as well as providing employment and income to millions of people. Cattle farming also contributes to individual and community identities and regional food cultures. Novel plant-based meat alternatives have been promoted as technologies that could transform the food system by reducing negative environmental, animal welfare, and health effects of meat production and consumption. Recent studies have conducted static analyses of shifts in diets globally and in the USA, but have not considered how the whole food system would respond to these changes, nor the ethical implications of these responses. We aimed to better explore these dynamics within the US food system and contribute a multiple perspective ethical assessment of plant-based alternatives to beef.
Methods
In this national modelling analysis, we explored multiple ethical perspectives and the implications of the adoption of plant-based alternatives to beef in the USA. We developed USAGE-Food, a modified version of USAGE (a detailed computable general equilibrium model of the US economy), by improving the representation of sector interactions and dependencies, and consumer behaviour to better reflect resource use across the food system and the substitutability of foods within households. We further extended USAGE, by linking estimates of the environmental footprint of US agriculture, to estimate how changes across the agriculture sector could alter the environmental impact of primary food production across the whole sector, not only the beef sector. Using USAGE-Food, we simulated four beef replacement scenarios against a baseline of current beef demand in the USA: BEEF10, in which beef expenditure is replaced by other foods and three scenarios wherein 10\%, 30\%, or 60\% of beef expenditure is replaced by plant-based alternatives.
Findings
The adoption of plant-based beef alternatives is likely to reduce the carbon footprint of US food production by 2�5�13�5\%, by reducing the number of animals needed for beef production by 2�12 million. Impacts on other dimensions are more ambiguous, as the agricultural workforce and natural resources, such as water and cropland, are reallocated across the food system. The shifting allocation of resources should lead to a more efficient food system, but could facilitate the expansion of other animal value chains (eg, pork and poultry) and increased exports of agricultural products. In aggregate, these changes across the food system would have a small, potentially positive, impact on national gross domestic product. However, they would lead to substantial disruptions within the agricultural economy, with the cattle and beef processing sectors decreasing by 7�45\%, challenging the livelihoods of the more than 1�5 million people currently employed in beef value chains (primary production and animal processing) in the USA.
Interpretation
Economic modelling suggests that the adoption of plant-based beef alternatives can contribute to reducing greenhouse gas emissions from the food system. Relocation of resources across the food system, simulated by our dynamic modelling approach, might mitigate gains across other environmental dimensions (ie, water or chemical use) and might facilitate the growth of other animal value chains. Although economic consequences at the country level are small, there would be concentrated losses within the beef value chain. Reduced carbon footprint and increased resource use efficiency of the food system are reasons for policy makers to encourage the continued development of these technologies. Despite this positive outcome, policy makers should recognise the ethical assessment of these transitions will be complex, and should remain vigilant to negative outcomes and be prepared to target policies to minimise the worst effects.

Looking back the development of the first GTAP LULC was no simple task as it required the expertise of several researchers to identify and process relevant geospatial information. And because of this, succeeding updates of the GTAP LULC database (namely v.7 for 2004 and v.8 for 2004, 2007) relied heavily on AEZ-region level data from GTAP LULCv.6 in order to update land cover and land use as well as share-out land rents.

This memorandum documents the development of the GTAP LULC v.9 database. In keeping with the multi-year release of GTAP v.9, the GTAP LULC v.9 data is developed for each benchmark year (i.e. 2004, 2007 and 2011). But unlike previous releases, GTAP LULCv.9 is created directly from publicly available high-resolution (i.e. 5-minute grid) spatial land cover and land use maps. Since these maps can be readily downloaded online, it is possible to replicate GTAP LULCv.9 if users know how to handle spatial data and if they follow the methods outlined in this document. Furthermore, by developing the capacity to handle spatial data within the Center, new spatial LULC information can be easily incorporated in future releases of the GTAP LULC.},

They are combined with TASTE V10a (Pelikan et al. 2020) which provides bilateral trade and tariffs revenues at the level of tariff lines.

  year       = {2019},
  abstract   = {In standard GTAP capital in each country is completely mobile between industries. Labor markets are
   characterized by either fixed real wages with completely elastic employment or completely flexible
   real wages that adjust to eliminate policy-induced movements in aggregate employment. These capital and
   labor assumptions limit the usefulness of standard GTAP as a tool for analyzing the path of impacts of
   policy changes from short-run to long-run. This paper describes modifications to standard GTAP to
   enhance its depiction of both capital and labor markets.
   With regard to capital, we introduce industry specificity mainly by a closure swap with little
   disruption to the standard model: the key idea is to endogenize a phantom tax on the use of capital
   by each industry in each region while exogenizing or pre-determining start-of-year capital availability
   in each industry and each region. A simplifying assumption that we retained from standard GTAP is
   that the commodity composition of investment is the same across industries in any given region.
   With regard to labor, we introduce an approach that has been used by the Centre of Policy Studies (CoPS)
   for the last 20 years in single-country models to trace out the deviations from basecase paths for
   employment by occupation generated by policy and other shocks. In the simplest version of these models,
   we assume in policy simulations that the deviation in the real wage rate for an occupation from its

is the specification of the supply of agricultural land in the face of restrictions over its availability, as
arises under REDD. By giving magnitudes to the effects of REDD and RED, our simulations provide a
defense against environmental skeptics who, in the absence of such estimates, can dismiss these policies as
being exorbitantly expensive. Although REDD and RED are in tension with respect to land use, the
paper shows that they could be implemented simultaneously without significant global problems for food supply. The paper does
however pinpoint some regional problems. Implementation of RED and REDD would cause large increases in food
prices in Indonesia and Southern Africa. The methodology used in this paper, if implemented at
a more detailed level, could be the basis of working out compensation packages that would be
needed to make pervasive RED and REDD policies politically feasible.},

main concepts employed: knowledge capital and learning curves. The common insight is that
technical change is driven by the development of knowledge capital and its characteristics
of being partly non-rival and partly non-excludable. There are various different
implementations of ETC. Recursive CGE models face particular difficulties in incorporating
ETC and increasing returns. The main limitations of current models are: the lack of
uncertainty analysis; the limited representation of the diffusion of technology; and the
homogeneous nature of agents in the models including the lack of representation of institutional

Climate policy goals represented as different CO2 stabilization levels are imposed, and the contribution of induced technological change (ITC) to meeting the goals is assessed. Findings indicate that climate policy induces additional technological change, in some models substantially. Its effect is a reduction of abatement costs in all participating models. The majority of models calculate abatement costs below 1 percent of present value aggregate gross world product for the period 2000-2100. The models predict different dynamics for rising carbon costs, with some showing a decline in carbon costs towards the end of the century. There are a number of reasons for differences in results between models; however four major drivers of differences are identified. First, the extent of the necessary CO2 reduction which depends mainly on predicted baseline emissions, determines how much a model is challenged to comply with climate policy. Second, when climate policy can offset market distortions, some models show that not costs but benefits accrue from climate policy. Third, assumptions about long-term investment behavior, e.g. foresight of actors and number of available investment options, exert a major influence. Finally, whether and how options for carbon-free energy are implemented (backstop and end-of-the-pipe technologies) strongly affects both the mitigation strategy and the abatement costs.},

We use the energy-systems optimization model MESSAGE considering endogenous learning for various technologies, such that they experience cost reductions as a function of accumulated capacity installations. We find that the existence of technological learning while reducing overall energy system costs becomes particularly important in the context of a long-term climate policy. Diversity in technological portfolios is emphasized and results indicate deployment of a range of energy technologies in reducing emissions. An important finding is that technological learning by itself is not sufficient for climate stabilization and that climate policies are an absolute necessary complimentary element. Under a climate constraint, spillovers across technologies and regions due to learning results in increased upfront investments and hence lower costs of carbon free technologies, thus resulting in technology deployment and emissions reductions, especially in developing countries. We conclude that learning and spillover effects can lead to technologically advanced cost-effective global energy transition pathways. We suggest that coordinated climate stabilization policies can serve as important institutional mechanisms that facilitate the required technological investments, especially in developing countries and thus ensure long-term cost reductions.},

to endogenise technical change in climate models. This recent literature has emphasized
that four factors---two inputs and two output---should play a major
role when modeling technical change in climate models. The two inputs are R&D investments and
Learning by Doing, the two outputs are energy-saving and fuel switching. Indeed, R&D investments and
Learning by Doing are the main drivers of a climate-friendly technical change that eventually affect
both energy intensity and fuel-mix. In this paper, we present and discuss an extension of
the FEEM-RICE model in which these four factors are explicitly accounted for. In our new specification
of endogenous technical change, an index of energy technical change depends on both Learning
by Researching and Learning by Doing. This index enters the equations defining energy intensity
(i.e. the amount of carbon energy required to produce one unit of output) and
carbon intensity (i.e. the level of carbonization of primarily used fuels). This new specification
is embodied in the RICE 99 integrated assessment climate model and then used to generate a
baseline scenario and to analyze the relationship between climate policy and technical change.
Sensitivity analysis is performed on different key parameters of the energy module in order
to obtain crucial insights into the relative importance of the main channels through which
technological changes affects the impact of human activities on climate.},

When technological progress is endogenous in this way, long-run growth in global GDP is partly explained by the model. Average permit prices and tax rates about $430/tC (1995) prices after 2050 are sufficient to stabilize atmospheric concentrations at 450ppm CO3 after 2100. They also lead to higher economic growth.},

Doing so brings to light how induced technical change may not only lower stabilization costs thanks to pure technological progress, but also trigger induction of final demand�effects critical to both the level of the carbon tax and the costs of policy given a specific stabilization target.

Most conventional models rely on a highly stylized and limited characterization of technology.
In these models, any desired changes in energy demand are driven largely by pure
price mechanisms such as energy taxes or carbon charges. In this paper, however,
we explore the mapping of discrete technology characterizations
and examine how cost-effective technologies and programs might prompt desirable
increases in energy efficiency. Using the commercial health care sector as
an example, we show how changes in energy efficiency and technology
investments might be more properly represented in policy models.},

subsidies could be an effective mechanism for meeting NDC targets for an important subset of countries,
even if only leading to global emissions reduction of between 1.8 and 3.2\% in 2030 depending on the oil price scenario.
Out of 17 countries with binding unconditional NDC targets, nine overreach their 2030 commitments under high
oil price scenario and six under low global oil prices. Furthermore, eleven countries reach at least 50\% of their
NDC reduction targets following subsidies elimination under low global oil price path.},

countries' resource rents and accelerate their emission-intensive diversification. (ii) Border
taxes on the carbon content of imports from fossil fuel-dependent countries do
not induce comprehensive cooperation, but broader trade sanctions do. (iii) Cooperative wellhead carbon
taxes can achieve cooperation without trade wars. (iv) Lower-income fossil fuel-dependent
countries with large untapped reserves need additional incentives and enablers to cooperate and diversify into
low-carbon assets. (v) Incentives to cooperate are misaligned between different fossil fuel-dependent
countries and between owners of different fuels. (vi) The strategies that maximize consumption and
growth in fossil fuel-dependent countries reduce the value of assets in extractive and heavy
industries. (vii) Asset diversification is a robust, long-term strategy but faces the tragedy of the horizon.},

  abstract  = {This book is the first stocktaking of what the decarbonization of the world
economy means for fossil fuel-dependent countries. These countries are the most
exposed to the impacts of global climate policies and, at the same time, are
often unprepared to manage them. They depend on the export of oil, gas, or coal;
the use of carbon-intensive infrastructure (for example, refineries, petrochemicals, and coal power plants); or both.
Fossil fuel-dependent countries face financial, fiscal, and macro-structural risks from
the transition of the global economy away from carbon-intensive fuels and the value chains
based on them. This book focuses on managing these transition risks and harnessing related
opportunities. Diversification and Cooperation in a Decarbonizing World identifies multiple strategies
that fossil fuel-dependent countries can pursue to navigate the turbulent waters of a low-carbon
transition. The policy and investment choices to be made in the next decade will determine these
countries' degree of exposure and overall resilience. Abandoning their
comfort zones and developing completely new skills and capabilities in a time
frame consistent with the Paris Agreement on climate change is a daunting challenge and
requires long-term revenue visibility and consistent policy leadership. This book proposes
a constructive framework for climate strategies for fossil fuel-dependent countries based on new
approaches to diversification and international climate cooperation. Climate policy
leaders share responsibility for creating room for all countries to contribute to the
goals of the Paris Agreement, taking into account the specific vulnerabilities and
opportunities each country faces.},

The combined set of papers in this special issue provides three key contributions to the literature. First, it highlights the need and room for improved transparency and possibly harmonisation of baseline assumptions, while avoiding herding behaviour where all models make identical assumptions. Secondly, it raises awareness of the crucial role of the baseline in quantitative dynamic CGE analysis. Thirdly, it provides the means and incentives to modelling teams to construct more sophisticated baselines by showing practices used in advanced large-scale models and highlighting the role of different drivers.

The purpose is to provide technical insight into recent advances in the modelling of current and future energy and abatement technologies and how they can be used to make baseline projections and scenarios 20-80 years ahead. Numerical illustrations are provided. In order to represent likely energy system transitions in the decades to come, modern CGE tools have learned from bottom-up studies. Three different approaches to baseline quantification can be distinguished: (a) exploiting bottom-up model characteristics to endogenize responses of technological investment and utilization, (b) relying on external information sources to feed the exogenous parameters and variables of the model, and (c) linking the model with more technology-rich, partial models to obtain bottom-up- and pathway-consistent parameters.},

Other topics scrutinized are the modelling of zeros, modelling of new technologies and new types of trade policies (trade in data and digitalization), phasing in of future trade policies, and migration and remittances. We conclude that there is relative consensus about the use of nested Armington preferences, whereas different scholars model the trade balance very differently. The discrepancy between baseline trade growth and historical trade growth is not considered in most models though highly relevant. Research efforts, both in terms of modelling and data collection, should be allocated to a better coverage of other items on the current account (capital income, remittances) and the inclusion of net foreign debt and asset positions, projecting trade growth based on historical patterns, and better tools to model the rapidly growing digital economy.},

below 2~\textdegree{}C and to actively pursue a 1.5~\textdegree{}C limit. Yet, according to the 2018 Economics Nobel
laureate William Nordhaus, these targets are economically suboptimal or unattainable and the world community should aim
for 3.5~\textdegree{}C in 2100 instead. Here, we show that the UN climate targets may be optimal even in
the Dynamic Integrated Climate--Economy (DICE) integrated assessment model, when appropriately updated. Changes to DICE include more
accurate calibration of the carbon cycle and energy balance model, and updated climate damage estimates.
To determine economically 'optimal' climate policy paths, we use the range of expert views
on the ethics of intergenerational welfare. When updates from climate science and economics are considered jointly,
we find that around three-quarters (or one-third) of expert views on intergenerational
welfare translate into economically optimal climate policy paths that are consistent with the 2~\textdegree{}C (or 1.5~\textdegree{}C) target.},

the general analytical solution of the system is given and two idealized climate change scenarios, one with a
step forcing and one with a linear forcing, are discussed. These solutions give a didactic description of the contributions from
the equilibrium response and of the fast and slow transient responses during a climate transition. Based on these analytical solutions, a
simple and physically based procedure to calibrate the two-layer model parameters using an AOGCM step-forcing experiment is introduced. Using this
procedure, the global thermal properties of 16 AOGCMs participating in phase 5 of the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP5) are determined. It is shown that,
for a given AOGCM, the EBM tuned with only the abrupt 4xCO2 experiment is able to reproduce with a very good accuracy
the temperature evolution in both a step-forcing and a linear-forcing experiment. The role of the upper-ocean and deep-ocean
heat uptakes in the fast and slow responses is also discussed. One of the main weaknesses of the simple
EBM discussed in this part is its ability to represent the evolution of the top-of-the-atmosphere radiative imbalance in the transient
regime. This issue is addressed in Part II by taking into account the efficacy factor of deep-ocean heat uptake.},

effect of deep-ocean heat uptake on the local strength of the radiative feedback in the transient regime. It involves
an additional term in the formulation of the radiative imbalance at the top of the atmosphere (TOA), which explains
the nonlinearity between radiative imbalance and the mean surface temperature observed in some AOGCMs. An analytical solution of

We demonstrated that the framework could (1) directly provide traceable physical land use results, (2) flexibly handle land productivity differences based on biophysical information, (3) explicitly introduce land conversion cost, and (4) provide welfare decomposition in light of land heterogeneity and conversion cost. An experiment of mandating a 10 percent increase in grain consumption in the US food sector showed that ignoring land heterogeneity and conversion cost would underestimate the welfare loss by 28 percent.},

Despite the recent controversy about opening up the distribution sector to foreign retailers, there is political will that remains in favor of pushing through reforms in India. In this paper, we quantify the economic impact of the removal of barriers to foreign investment in multi-brand retailing on different stakeholders using a newly developed general equilibrium model. The model accounts explicitly for both foreign direct investment and the activities of foreign affiliates using heterogeneous production technologies. We find that the unilateral reduction of barriers to FDI in distribution services in India benefits the economy as a whole, consumers, and foreign producers but hurts domestic distributors. Nevertheless, when we consider the associated productivity improvements documented in the literature to downstream and upstream industries, we find that domestic producers are expected to benefit from the liberalization of the distribution sector as well.},

It is another mega FTA in the Asia-Pacific region after the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP). This paper investigates the potential effect of the RCEP on foreign direct investment (FDI) with a focus on China through a computable general equilibrium (CGE) model. The CGE model is built on the extended theory of firm heterogeneity to FDI, which is able to capture the intensive margin and extensive margin of FDI increase. The RCEP is simulated to impact on FDI through a direct effect of FDI liberalization and an indirect effect of trade liberalization. Simulation results show that the RCEP will encourage FDI to China through its trade effect and the direct FDI effect. While the competition from imports drives out the least productive foreign invested firms, the export expansion of firms using FDI will lead to an increase in foreign investment. In addition, the facilitation of trade in intermediate goods tends to promote vertical FDI. The direct FDI effect from investment liberalization will evidently promote FDI from partners. As for the welfare effect, China will gain US$103~214 billion, accounting for 1.08~2.24% of GDP.},

Using this model, we examine how U.S. offshoring activities in China and Mexico would change if the two major U.S. trading partners adopt similar investment policies towards the United States, in three different sectors: computer and electronic products; transportation equipment; and wholesale and retail trade, where there is a large presence of U.S. foreign affiliates in China and Mexico.  The simulations from our CGE model indicate that both China and Mexico would benefit from the U.S. FDI inflow, though the impact is bigger over the Mexican economy than the Chinese economy.  For China�s computer and electronic products sector in particular, the simulation results indicate that China plays a role as a production base and export center for computer and electronic products to the United States.  The inflow of U.S. capital into China�s computer and electronic products sector expands the production of U.S. foreign affiliates in China, and in turn drives up these foreign affiliates� exports of computer and electronic products back to the United States.  Meanwhile, change in output and trade flows in Hongkong indicates that Hongkong is an important input provider for the production of computer and electronic products in China.  Simulation results from the liberalization in Mexico�s transportation equipment sector indicate that the inflow of U.S. capital into Mexico�s motor vehicle sector would expand the production of U.S. foreign affiliates and in turn their exports back to the United States.},

countries are required to submit National Emission Inventories (NEI) to benchmark reductions in greenhouse gas

options and priorities may vary. The territorial system boundary used by the UNFCCC has been
criticised for not including international transportation and potentially causing carbon leakage.
To address these issues, past literature has argued in favour of using
consumption-based NEI in climate policy. This article discusses several issues in moving
from the standard production-based NEI to consumption-based NEI. First, two distinct accounting approaches for
constructing consumption-based NEI are presented. The approaches differ in the
allocation of intermediate consumption of imported products. Second, a consistent method
of weighting production-based and consumption-based NEI is discussed. This is an extension
of the previous literature on shared responsibility to NEI. Third, due to increased
uncertainty and a wide system boundary it may be difficult to implement
consumption-based NEI directly into climate policy. Several alternative options for
incorporating consumption-based inventories into climate policy are discussed.},

We link a global recursive dynamic computable general equilibrium model ENVISAGE with the GIDD microsimulation model and explore three levels of mitigation effort and five carbon pricing options (trade coalitions). Results suggest that while there is a higher incidence of poverty in all scenarios, mainly driven by lower economic growth, Nationally Determined Contribution (NDC) policies result in progressive income distribution at the global level. Such progressivity is caused not only by lower relative prices of food versus non-food commodities, but also by a general decline in skill wage premia.},

Second, it uses the OECD's global trade model to

stability. In this scenario, countries are less exposed to
foreign shocks, but they are also less efficient and
less able to cushion shocks through trade. Quantitatively,

  abstract = {The analysis of uncertainty in large-scale agricultural economic
models has gained attention from a policymakers and researchers' viewpoint.
The different methodologies available vary depending on data availability
and the nature of the variables subject to analysis, which in turn influences
the outcomes. When evaluating the results of previously applied partial
stochastic methodologies to partial equilibrium models, underperformance and
generation of biases have been observed. This paper evaluates different
stochastic methods for introducing yield and macroeconomic uncertainty
in a large-scale agricultural economic model and proposes a new methodology
for partial uncertainty analysis consisting of a combination of parametric
and non-parametric estimators chosen to minimize the statistical prediction
error and distributional assumptions. Results suggest that the best
methodologies are those relaxing distributional assumptions and allowing
for a better representation of historical variability. For uncertainty
extraction, the cubic polynomial (for yields) and the multivariate
vector auto-regression (for macroeconomic variables) methods perform
best. For uncertainty simulation, tests favor semi-parametric
methods against parametric approaches. These methods are applied to
the ex-ante analysis of global agricultural commodity markets and
supplement the traditional deterministic analysis with a statistical
representation of stochastic uncertainty.},

Here we analyze the consequences of global warming for agricultural workers and the crops
they cultivate using a global economic model (GTAP) with explicit treatment of the
physiological impacts of heat stress on humans� ability to work. Based on two metrics of
heat stress and two labor functions, combined with a meta-analysis of crop yields, we
provide an analysis of climate, impacts both on agricultural labor force, as well as on
staple crop yields, thereby accounting for the interacting effect of climate change on both
land and labor. Here we analyze the two sets of impacts on staple crops, while also expanding the
labor impacts to highlight the potential importance on non-staple crops. We find, worldwide,
labor and yield impacts within staple grains are equally important at +3~\textdegree{}C warming, relative
to the 1986--2005 baseline. Furthermore, the widely overlooked labor impacts are dominant in two of
the most vulnerable regions: sub-Saharan Africa and Southeast Asia. In those regions, heat stress with 3~\textdegree{}C
global warming could reduce labor capacity in agriculture by 30--50%,
increasing food prices and requiring much higher levels of employment in the farm sector.
The global welfare loss at this level of warming could reach \$136 billion, with crop prices rising by 5\%, relative to baseline.},

Keynesian multipliers at the macro level have multisectoral counterparts

completely demand driven and do not incorporate supply constrains

models have been developed which capture nonlinear substitution
possibilities and multisectoral supply-demand interactions, and
also incorporate macro variables and mechanisms for achieving
balance among aggregates. "Marginal" multipliers can be derived
for CGE models using the Jacobian matrix of partial derivatives
at a given equilibrium. This paper develops an approach to
analyzing Jacobian multipliers from a CGE model that decomposes
macro, sectoral, and institutional linkages in a SAM

for the period 1990--2018, integrating data from crop and livestock production, on-farm energy use,
land use and land use change, domestic food transport and food waste disposal. With these new country-level
components in place, and by adding global and regional estimates of energy use in food supply chains,
we estimate that total GHG emissions from the food system were about 16 $\textrm{CO}_2\textrm{eq yr}^{-1}$ in 2018,
or one-third of the global anthropogenic total. Three quarters of these emissions, 13 Gt $\textrm{CO}_2\textrm{eq yr}^{-1}$,
were generated either within the farm gate or in pre- and post-production activities, such as
manufacturing, transport, processing, and waste disposal. The remainder was generated through land use change
at the conversion boundaries of natural ecosystems to agricultural land. Results further indicate that pre- and
post-production emissions were proportionally more important in developed than in developing countries, and
that during 1990--2018, land use change emissions decreased while pre- and post-production emissions increased.
We also report results on a per capita basis, showing world total food systems per capita emissions
decreasing during 1990--2018 from 2.9 to 2.2 t $\textrm{CO}_2\textrm{eq cap}^{-1}$, with per capita emissions in
developed countries about twice those in developing countries in 2018.
Our findings also highlight that conventional IPCC categories, used by countries to report emissions in the
National GHG inventory, systematically underestimate the contribution of the food system to total anthropogenic emissions.
We provide a comparative mapping of food system categories and activities in order to better quantify
food-related emissions in national reporting and identify mitigation opportunities across the entire food system.},

Using an activity analysis approach, we capture non-linearities that typically characterise

flexible and can accommodate greenhouse gas and air pollution abatement, as well as
modelling carbon capture and storage (CCS). Here, we illustrate this approach for non-CO2 greenhouse gases in a
large-scale Computable General Equilibrium (CGE) model and compare results with
a fitted marginal abatement curve and with completely excluding non-CO2 greenhouse gases.
Results show that excluding non-CO2 abatement options leads to an overestimation of the total abatement cost.
When the detailed bottom-up technology implementation is replaced by a fitted
smooth marginal abatement cost curve, significant over- or underestimations of abatement levels and
costs can emerge for particular pollutant-sector-region combinations.},

  abstract = {Inorganic carbon in the ocean is modelled as a passive tracer advected by a
three-dimensional current field computed from a dynamical global ocean circulation model.
The carbon exchange between the ocean and atmosphere is determined
directly from the (temperature-dependent) chemical interaction rates in the
mixed layer, using a standard CO{}$_2$ flux relation at the air-sea interface.
The carbon cycle is closed by coupling the ocean to a one-layer, horizontally
diffusive atmosphere. Biological sources and sinks are not included. In this form
the ocean carbon model contains essentially no free tuning parameters. The model may be regarded
as a reference for interpreting numerical experiments with extended versions of the model
including biological processes in the ocean (Bacastow R and Maier-Reimer E in prep.)
and on land (Esser G et al in prep.). Qualitatively, the model reproduces the principal
features of the observed CO{}$_2$ distribution bution in the surface ocean. However, the amplitudes of
surface pCO{}$_2$ are underestimated in upwelling regions by a factor of the order of 1.5
due to the missing biological pump. The model without biota may, nevertheless, be applied
to compute the storage capacity of the ocean to first order for anthropogenic CO{}$_2$ emissions.
In the linear regime, the response of the model may be represented by an impulse response function
which can be approximated by a superposition of exponentials with different amplitudes and
time constants. This provides a simple reference for comparison with box models. The largest-amplitude
($\sim 0.35$) exponential has a time constant of 300 years. The effective storage capacity of the
oceans is strongly dependent on the time history of the anthropogenic input, as found also in earlier box model studies.},

Sustainable intensification of livestock production systems might become a key climate mitigation technology. However, livestock production systems vary substantially, making the implementation of climate mitigation policies a formidable challenge. Here, we provide results from an economic model using a detailed and high-resolution representation of livestock production systems. We project that by 2030 autonomous transitions toward more efficient systems would decrease emissions by 736 million metric tons of carbon dioxide equivalent per year (MtCO2e?y?1), mainly through avoided emissions from the conversion of 162 Mha of natural land. A moderate mitigation policy targeting emissions from both the agricultural and land-use change sectors with a carbon price of US$10 per tCO2e could lead to an abatement of 3,223 MtCO2e?y?1. Livestock system transitions would contribute 21% of the total abatement, intra- and interregional relocation of livestock production another 40%, and all other mechanisms would add 39%. A comparable abatement of 3,068 MtCO2e?y?1 could be achieved also with a policy targeting only emissions from land-use change. Stringent climate policies might lead to reductions in food availability of up to 200 kcal per capita per day globally. We find that mitigation policies targeting emissions from land-use change are 5 to 10 times more efficient?measured in "total abatement calorie cost"?than policies targeting emissions from livestock only. Thus, fostering transitions toward more productive livestock production systems in combination with climate policies targeting the land-use change appears to be the most efficient lever to deliver desirable climate and food availability outcomes.},

up in an integrated assessment of mitigation pathways. In this study we analyze a comprehensive portfolio of CDR options in terms of their
regional and temporal deployment patterns in climate change mitigation pathways and the resulting challenges. We show that any CDR option with
sufficient potential can reduce the economic costs of achieving the 1.5 \textdegree{}C target substantially without increasing the
temperature overshoot. CDR helps to reduce net CO$_2$ emissions faster and achieve carbon neutrality earlier.
The regional distribution of CDR deployment in cost-effective mitigation pathways depends on which options are available.
If only enhanced weathering of rocks on croplands or re- and afforestation are available,
Latin America and Asia cover nearly all of global CDR deployment. Besides fairness and sustainability concerns, such
a regional concentration would require large international transfers and thus strong international institutions. In our
study, the full portfolio scenario is the most balanced from a regional perspective. This
indicates that different CDR options should be developed such that all
regions can contribute according to their regional potentials.},

In this paper we examine the role of non-CO2 greenhouse gases in meeting long-term climate change targets. For this purpose, we develop climate mitigation scenarios aimed at achieving long-term stabilization of global radiative forcing. We use the MESSAGE model for a thorough bottom-up representation of the six Kyoto greenhouse gases and corresponding mitigation technologies. This approach endogenizes energy feedback effects from mitigation of non-CO2 gases and takes into account the interplay and side benefits that exist across GHGs. We analyze two mitigation scenarios that stabilize global radiative forcing at 4.5 W/m� as compared to pre-industrial times�one allowing only for CO2 mitigation and another with multigas mitigation. In addition, we also investigate a lower stabilization level of 3 W/m� and look into the implications this has for abatement strategies. Our approach helps us to identify a portfolio of measures in the energy, industry and agricultural sectors for achieving a proposed climate target. We find that considering the full basket of GHGs improves the effectiveness of the mitigation portfolio resulting in significantly lower costs, especially in the short term. In the long run, the bulk of the emissions reductions are still found to come from CO2 and this effect becomes more pronounced under the more stringent climate target. This emphasizes the importance of a diverse mitigation portfolio that includes both CO2 and non-CO2 related abatement options in meeting long-term climate targets.},

In recent years, however, increasing attention has been dedicated to the benefits of reducing emissions of non-CO3 GHGs such as methane and nitrous oxide. Increased attention to the potential role of these gases in a GHG reduction policy increased the need for better data on the costs of non-CO2 GHG abatement for countries and regions outside of the US and the European Union (EU). Using a net present value calculation, this analysis develops regionally adjusted costs per mitigation option and marginal abatement cost curves by region for use in economic models. The result is worldwide cost estimates for methane and nitrous oxide from waste, energy and the industrial sectors. This paper also demonstrates the ability to significantly reduce greenhouse gases from these sectors with current technologies and the low cost of methane and nitrous oxide relative to CO3 reductions.},

At the moment, non-CO2 gasses (methane, nitrous oxide, PFCs, HFCs and SF6) contribute to about a quarter of the global emissions. The analysis shows that including these non-CO2 gases in mitigation analysis is crucial in formulating a cost-effective response. For stabilisation at 4.5 W/m�, a multi-gas approach leads to 40% lower costs than an approach that would focus at CO2-only. Within the assumptions used in this study, the non-CO2 gasses contribution to total reduction is very large under less stringent targets (up to 60%), but declines under stringent targets. While stabilising at 3.7 W/m� obviously leads to larger environmental benefits than the 4.5 W/m� case (temperature increase in 2100 are 1.9 and 2.3�C, respectively), the costs of the lower target are higher (0.80% and 0.34% of GDP in 2100, respectively). Improving knowledge on how future reduction potential for non-CO2 gasses could develop is shown to be a crucial research question.},

  abstract = {The consequences of climate policy and the impacts of climate change vary among different types of households depending on their income level, expenditure pattern, and other socioeconomic characteristics. Global economy-environment models that are used to assess climate change issues traditionally do not distinguish households by income or other attributes. To facilitate progress in this area, we review and assess literature on methods to include household heterogeneity in global long-term Computable General Equilibrium (CGE) models. We distinguish among three categories of approaches: 1) the explicit modeling of multiple household types within the CGE framework, 2) micro-simulation modeling, and 3) direct modeling of income distribution. For each of these approaches we describe the method, key assumptions, limitations and several prominent examples from the literature. Moreover, we discuss data needs, including the contents of household survey data, their availability and processing. We conclude with an overview of what each method could provide for global, long-term climate-related research.},

  abstract  = {This paper reports on the global potential for carbon sequestration in forest plantations, and the reduction of carbon emissions from deforestation, in response to six carbon price scenarios from 2000 to 2100. These carbon price scenarios cover a range typically seen in global integrated assessment models. The world forest sector was disaggregated into ten regions, four largely temperate, developed regions: the European Union, Oceania, Russia, and the United States; and six developing, mostly tropical, regions: Africa, Central America, China, India, Rest of Asia, and South America. Three mitigation options�long- and short-rotation forestry, and the reduction of deforestation�were analyzed using a global dynamic partial equilibrium model (GCOMAP). Key findings of this work are that cumulative carbon gain ranges from 50.9 to 113.2 Gt C by 2100, higher carbon prices early lead to earlier carbon gain and vice versa, and avoided deforestation accounts for 51 to 78% of modeled carbon gains by 2100. The estimated present value of cumulative welfare change in the sector ranges from a decline of $158 billion to a gain of $81 billion by 2100. The decline is associated with a decrease in deforestation.},

  abstract  = {First steps toward a broad climate agreement, such as the Kyoto Protocol, have focused on less than global geographic coverage. We consider instead a policy that is less comprehensive in term of greenhouse gases (GHGs), including only the non-CO3 GHGs, but is geographically comprehensive. Abating non-CO3 GHGs may be seen as less of a threat to economic development and therefore it may be possible to involve developing countries in such a policy even though they have resisted limits on CO3 emissions. The policy we consider involves a GHG price of about $15 per ton carbon-equivalent (tce) levied only on the non-CO3 GHGs and held at that level through the century. We estimate that such a policy would reduce the global mean surface temperature in 2100 by about 0.55� C; if only methane is covered that alone would achieve a reduction of 0.3� to 0.4� C. We estimate the Kyoto Protocol in its current form would achieve a 0.25� C reduction in 2100 if Parties to it maintained it as is through the century. Furthermore, we estimate the costs of the non-CO3 policies to be a small fraction of the Kyoto policy. Whether as a next step to expand the Kyoto Protocol, or as a separate initiative running parallel to it, the world could well make substantial progress on limiting climate change by pursuing an agreement to abate the low cost non-CO3 GHGs. The results suggest that it would be useful to proceed on global abatement of non-CO3 GHGs so that lack of progress on negotiations to limit CO3 does not allow these abatement opportunities to slip away.},

  abstract  = {This paper examines the role of climate forcing agents other than carbon dioxide using the MiniCAM integrated assessment model for both no-climate-policy and policy emissions scenarios. Non-CO2 greenhouse-gas forcing is dominated by methane and tropospheric ozone. Assumptions about the prevalence of methane recovery and local air pollution controls in the no-policy cases are a critical determinant of methane and ozone-precursor emissions. When these factors are considered, emissions are substantially reduced relative to earlier estimates. This reduces their potential as climate mitigation agents through specific climate policies. Nevertheless, the addition of non-CO2 greenhouse gas and ozone precursor abatement options significantly reduces mitigation costs in the first half of the 21st century (by up to 40%) compared to the case where only CO2 abatement options are pursued. While the influences of aerosols are small by the end of the century, there is a significant interaction in the early 21st century between policies to reduce CO2 emissions and SO2 emissions, even in the presence of SO2-related pollution control policies. The attendant reduced aerosol cooling can more than offset the reduction in warming that accrues from reduced CO2. When non-CO2 gases are included in the policy, the net effect is that global-mean climate change to 2050 is practically unaffected by mitigation policy.},

The second empirical application illustrates how a matrix of compensated price elasticities can be obtained with only a priori knowledge of its direct and diagonal elements.

Multi-regional, multi-sectoral and multi-gas CGE model and simple climate change model simulated long-term climate stabilization emission path. Preliminary results showed that multi gas mitigation options including CH4 and N3O abatement technologies will reduce GDP loss more than CO3 only mitigation options for long-term climate stabilization, even though CO3 mitigation options will reduce not only CO3 emissions but non-CO3 gas emissions simultaneously. It is necessary to collect regional non-CO3 gas data (emission, technology options, and so on) and conduct more sensitivity analysis with computer simulation model to reduce uncertainty of non-CO3 gas.},

Combined with an international emission permit scheme that is based on the Soft Landing approach, an emission profile respecting climate targets of 550 ppmv provides a relatively soft constraint case for developing countries. The multi-gas analyses first of all demonstrate the relevance of the approach as changing from a CO3�only to a multi-gas strategy either allows to increase total abatement of 25% for the same Marginal Abatement Cost or to decrease the MAC of approximately 30% for the same total abatement. Not surprisingly however, the impacts on world demand and primary fuel mix are less pronounced in the multi-gas case. This is easily understandable as a counterpart for introducing more margins of freedom in the abatement effort.},

The price paths were chosen to simulate several different climate change policies. The results indicate that global sequestration could range from 48�147 Pg C by 2105 for carbon prices ranging from $100 to more than $800 per t C by the end of the century. The timing of sequestration is found to be sensitive to the assumed carbon price path. Low initial carbon prices ($10 - $20 per t C in 2010) followed by rapid price increases, as might occur if policy makers try to stabilize future concentrations, suggest little, if any, sequestration during the next 20 years (-0.2 to 4.5 Pg C). If policy makers develop policies that support higher initial carbon prices, ranging from $75 to $100 per t C, 17 to 23 Pg C could be sequestered in forests over the next 20 years. Overall, our results indicate that forestry is not an efficient stop-gap measure for long-term policy goals, but that it is instead an important long-term partner with other mitigation options.},

If CO2 emission reduction were the only possibility to meet this target, the net present value of consumption losses would be $45 trillion; with abatement of the other gases added, costs fall to $33 trillion. The bulk of these costs savings can be ascribed to reductions of nitrous oxide. Because nitrous oxide emission reduction is so much more important than methane emission reduction, the choice of equivalence metric between the greenhouse gases does not matter much. Sensitivity analyses show that the shape of the cost curves for CH4 and N2O emission reductions matter, and that the inclusion of sulphate aerosols makes policy targets substantially harder to achieve. The costs of emission reduction vary greatly with the choice of stabilisation target. A target of 4.5 Wm-2 is not justified by our current knowledge of the damage costs of climate change.},

In order to take advantage of this newly available information, we have incorporated the detailed country prepared inventories and projections into an overall global estimation framework. The source and country level estimation methodology presented in this study allows for more accurate anthropogenic emission level estimates at a global level.

The emission and reduction potential of CO3 and non-CO3 GHGs are assessed here using an integrated assessment model under climate change targets. The implications on gas life as well as abatement timing uncertainty on costs, technological availability, etc. are discussed. The introduction of additional multigas reductions will cut the economic burden of achieving a given climate change target. The conclusions are threefold; (1) Multigas mitigation is a cost effective strategy compared to CO3-only mitigation under the same climate target, (2) CO3 mitigation is expected to lead to ancillary reductions in CH4, N3O and SOx emissions, and (3) There is great uncertainty in the assessment of non-CO3 GHG mitigation opportunities.},

The models' distinguishing characteristic is that the 1992 program is not thought of as eliminating mysterious barriers to trade (analogous to tariffs), but as making competition more intense, i.e., raising the elasticity of demand perceived by producers. The 1992 program, the model predicts, will cause a large redistribution of industrial activities between countries. The calculated welfare gains, while substantial, are much smaller than those presented in a well known paper of Smith and Venables.},

Systematic sensitivity analysis shows that there is virtually no chance of a welfare increase less than 3%, but a 6.6% chance of a welfare gain greater than 18%.

A multi-gas approach with GWPs reduces the costs by 8 percent when compared with CO3 reductions only, whereas the costs may be reduced by an additional 2 percent if using flexible metrics. If compared with the use of GWPs, we find that efficient weights increase the cost savings of including non-CO3 gases in climate policy by 15-40%, depending on the stabilization goal.},

we present a new set of quantitative evidence to demonstrate that, per unit of overall nutrient value supplied by a given commodity,
the demand for land suitable for human-edible crop production is considerably smaller under ruminant systems than monogastric systems, and consistently so
at both farm and regional scales. We also demonstrate that imposition of a {na\"ively} designed "red meat tax" has the potential to invite socioeconomic
losses far greater than its environmental benefits, due largely to the induced misallocation of resources at the national scale. Our
results reiterate the risk inherent in an excessively climate-focused debate on the role of livestock in human society and call for more
multidimensional approaches of sustainability assessment to draw better-balanced policy packages.},

Existing techniques for validation based on quantitative assessments sometimes cause an underestimation of the performance of models due to time shifts, accelerations and delays or systematic differences between measurement and simulation.  However, for the application of such models it is often more important to reproduce essential patterns instead of seemingly exact numerical values.  This paper presents techniques to identify patterns and numerical methods to measure the consistency of patterns between observations and model results. An orthogonal set of deviance measures for absolute, relative and ordinal scale was compiled to provide informations about the type of difference. Furthermore, two different approaches accounting for time shifts were presented. The first one transforms the time to take time delays and speed differences into account. The second one describes known qualitative criteria dividing time series into interval units in accordance to their main features. The methods differ in their basic concepts and in the form of the resulting criteria. Both approaches and the deviance measures discussed are implemented in an R package. All methods are demonstrated by means of water quality measurements and simulation data.  The proposed quality criteria allow to recognize systematic differences and time shifts between time series and to conclude about the quantitative and qualitative similarity of patterns.},

  abstract = {One of the commonly used tools for detecting changes in climatic and hydrologic time series is trend analysis. A number of statistical tests exist to assess the significance of trends in time series. One of the commonly used non-parametric trend tests is the Mann-Kendall trend test. The null hypothesis in the Mann-Kendall test is that the data are independent and randomly ordered. However, the existence of positive autocorrelation in the data increases the probability of detecting trends when actually none exist, and vice versa. Although this is a well-known fact, few studies have addressed this issue, and autocorrelation in the data is often ignored. In this study, the effect of autocorrelation on the variance of the Mann-Kendall trend test statistic is discussed. A theoretical relationship is derived to calculate the variance of the Mann-Kendall test statistic for autocorrelated data. The special cases of AR(1) and MA(1) dependence are discussed as examples. An approximation to the theoretical relationship is also presented in order to reduce computation time for long time series. Based on the modified value of the variance of the Mann-Kendall trend test statistic, a modified non-parametric trend test which is suitable for autocorrelated data is proposed. The accuracy of the modified test in terms of its empirical significance level was found to be superior to that of the original Mann-Kendall trend test without any loss of power. The modified test is applied to rainfall as well as streamflow data to demonstrate its performance as compared to the original Mann-Kendall trend test.},

  abstract  = {Owing to the methane (CH4) produced by rumen fermentation, ruminants are a source of greenhouse gas (GHG) and are perceived as a problem. We propose that with appropriate regenerative crop and grazing management, ruminants not only reduce overall GHG emissions, but also facilitate provision of essential ecosystem services, increase soil carbon (C) sequestration, and reduce environmental damage. We tested our hypothesis by examining biophysical impacts and the magnitude of all GHG emissions from key agricultural production activities, including comparisons of arable- and pastoral-based agroecosystems. Our assessment shows that globally, GHG emissions from domestic ruminants represent 11.6\% (1.58 Gt C y-1) of total anthropogenic emissions, while cropping and soil-associated emissions contribute 13.7\% (1.86 Gt C y-1). The primary source is soil erosion (1 Gt C y-1), which in the United States alone is estimated at 1.72 Gt of soil y-1. Permanent cover of forage plants is highly effective in reducing soil erosion, and ruminants consuming only grazed forages under appropriate management result in more C sequestration than emissions. Incorporating forages and ruminants into regeneratively managed agroecosystems can elevate soil organic C, improve soil ecological function by minimizing the damage of tillage and inorganic fertilizers and biocides, and enhance biodiversity and wildlife habitat. We conclude that to ensure long-term sustainability and ecological resilience of agroecosystems, agricultural production should be guided by policies and regenerative management protocols that include ruminant grazing. Collectively, conservation agriculture supports ecologically healthy, resilient agroecosystems and simultaneously mitigates large quantities of anthropogenic GHG emissions.},

progress and less resource-intensive lifestyles, are crucial elements for progress
towards the UN Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). However, using an integrated modelling
framework covering 56 indicators or proxies across all 17 SDGs, we show that they are
insufficient to reach the targets. An additional sustainable development package, including
international climate finance, progressive redistribution of carbon pricing revenues, sufficient and
healthy nutrition and improved access to modern energy, enables a more comprehensive
sustainable development pathway. We quantify climate and SDG outcomes, showing that these
interventions substantially boost progress towards many aspects of the UN Agenda 2030
and simultaneously facilitate reaching ambitious climate targets. Nonetheless, several
important gaps remain; for example, with respect to the eradication of extreme poverty
(180~million people remaining in 2030). These gaps can be closed by 2050 for
many SDGs while also respecting the 1.5~\textdegree{}C target
and several other planetary boundaries.},

impacts of climate change can be attributed to these three factors. Our modelling framework
consisting of global, multisectoral impact models coupled with an integrated assessment model enables
us to estimate the global total economic impacts of climate change while incorporating these
uncertainty sources. Whereas the most pessimistic pathway without mitigation would result in
a net economic impact equivalent to 6.6\% (3.9--8.6\%) of global gross domestic
product at the end of this century, the pathways with stringent mitigation would
limit the impact to around or less than 1\%. Although the uncertainties are great, the
climate change mitigation pathway is the dominant factor and socioeconomic developments
can also contribute to alleviate the impacts of climate change. These results suggest that
decisions on mitigation and development have a great influence in determining the economic impacts of
climate change, regardless of the uncertainties in the climate response.},

we develop a meta-model that disentangles the uncertainties of these factors

cost-minimising and cost-benefit modelling communities. Typically, mitigation scenarios focus on
minimum-cost pathways achieving the Paris Agreement without accounting for damages; our
analysis shows doing so could double the initial carbon price. In a?full cost-benefit
setting, we show that the optimal temperature target does not exceed 2.5~\textdegree{}C when
considering medium damages and low discount rates, even with high mitigation costs.
With low mitigation costs, optimal temperature change drops to 1.5~\textdegree{} or less.

This study investigates the links between growth, climate change, and conflict
by simulating future civil conflict using new scenario data for five alternative socioeconomic pathways with
different mitigation and adaptation assumptions, known as the shared socioeconomic pathways
(SSPs). We develop a statistical model of the historical effect of key socioeconomic variables
on country-specific conflict incidence, 1960--2013. We then forecast the annual incidence of conflict,
2014--2100, along the five SSPs. We find that SSPs with high investments in broad
societal development are associated with the largest reduction in conflict risk.
This is most pronounced for the least developed countries---poverty alleviation
and human capital investments in poor countries are much more effective instruments
to attain global peace and stability than further improvements to wealthier economies.
Moreover, the SSP that describes a sustainability pathway, which poses the
lowest climate change challenges, is as conducive to global peace as the conventional development pathway.},

this is that existing studies do not triangulate insights from different methods and
pay little attention to relevant context factors and especially causal pathways.
By combining statistical approaches with systematic evidence from QCA and qualitative case
studies in an innovative multi-method research design, we show that climate-related
disasters increase the risk of armed conflict onset. This link is
highly context-dependent and we find that countries with large populations, political exclusion
of ethnic groups, and a low level of human development are particularly vulnerable. For
such countries, almost one third of all conflict onsets over the 1980-2016 period
have been preceded by a disaster within 7 days. The robustness of the
effect is reduced for longer time spans. Case study evidence points to improved opportunity structures
for armed groups rather than aggravated grievances as the main mechanism connecting disasters and conflict onset.},

We link a global recursive dynamic computable general equilibrium model ENVISAGE with the GIDD
microsimulation model and explore three levels of mitigation effort and five carbon pricing options
(trade coalitions). Results suggest that while there is a higher incidence of poverty in
all scenarios, mainly driven by lower economic growth, Nationally Determined Contribution (NDC) policies
result in a progressive income distribution at the global level. Such progressivity is caused
not only by lower relative prices of food versus non-food commodities, but also by a
general decline in the skill wage premia. Achievement of the NDC targets without regional cooperation results in 0.45\%
increase in the number of people living in extreme poverty (below PPP$1.90/day) by 2030, while a more ambitious
2~\textdegree{}C-consistent target increases this number to 1.25\%.
Global cooperation significantly eases the burden on poor, reducing the poverty headcount
by almost three times in the case of 2~\textdegree{}C-consistent target and bringing it to
the baseline scenario level in the case of NDC target. The global Gini
coefficient falls between 0.01 and 0.04 percentage points, while reduction in the Theil
index is between 0.01 and 0.11 percentage points. Results also indicate that the reductions in
inequality come mainly from a reduction in income from top earners, as the results
are much more sensitive to the NDC policies closer to the top of the income distribution.},

reduction targets---so-called Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs)---in order to combat global warming.
The study suggests that aligning NDCs with the commonly agreed 2~\textdegree{}C temperature target will
induce global economic costs of roughly 1\% in 2030. However, these costs are unevenly
distributed across regions. Countries exporting fossil fuels are most adversely affected from
the transition towards a low-carbon economy. In order to reduce adjustment costs at the global and
regional level, comprehensive emissions trading which exploits least-cost abatement options is strongly desirable to
avoid contentious normative debates on equitable burden sharing. Lump-sum recycling of revenues from
emissions pricing, in equal amounts to every household, appeals as an attractive strategy
to mitigate regressive effects and thereby improving the social acceptability of stringent climate policy.},

current trends continue beyond 2020, of two scenarios where the Intended Nationally Determined Contributions have been included, and of a
2\textdegree{}C scenario in line with keeping global warming below the limits agreed in international negotiations.
The report presents an updated version of the modelling work that supported by DG CLIMA in the UNFCCC
negotiations that resulted in the Paris Agreement of the COP21 in December 2015.
In the Reference scenario, emissions trigger global warming above 3\textdegree{}C. In the INDC scenarios, regions adopt domestic
policies that result in global changes in emissions and energy use, and would result in the long term in
a global warming around 3\textdegree{}C; the INDCs cover 28-44\% of the cumulated emissions reductions necessary to remain below a
2\textdegree{}C warming. In the 2\textdegree{}C scenario, all regions realise domestic emission cuts to stay below 2\textdegree{}C,
with various profiles in 2020-2050 depending on their national characteristics. Reduction of non-CO2 emissions (34\% in 2030),
energy efficiency (20\%) and the deployment of renewable energies (20\%) are the main options contributing in the mitigation effort.
A significant number of regions draw economic benefits from shifting their expenditures on fossil energy imports to
investments. GDP growth rates are marginally affected in most regions by global efforts to reduce
emissions. Crucially, high growth rates are maintained in fast-growing low-income regions. Delaying actions to stay
below 2\textdegree{}C add large economic costs. The analysis uses the POLES and GEM-E3 models in a
framework where economic welfare is maximised while tackling climate change.},

Climate economists have only recently begun incorporating them in economic models. We synthesize this
emerging literature and provide unified, geophysically realistic estimates of the economic impacts of
eight climate tipping points with an emphasis on the social cost of carbon, a key policy input.
Climate scientists have long emphasized the importance of climate tipping points like
thawing permafrost, ice sheet disintegration, and changes in atmospheric circulation. Yet, save
for a few fragmented studies, climate economics has either ignored them or represented them in
highly stylized ways. We provide unified estimates of the economic impacts of all eight climate
tipping points covered in the economic literature so far using a meta-analytic integrated assessment model (IAM) with a
modular structure. The model includes national-level climate damages from rising temperatures and sea levels
for 180 countries, calibrated on detailed econometric evidence and simulation modeling. Collectively, climate
tipping points increase the social cost of carbon (SCC) by \~{}25\% in our main specification.
The distribution is positively skewed, however. We estimate an \~{}10\% chance of climate tipping points more
than doubling the SCC. Accordingly, climate tipping points increase global economic risk.
A spatial analysis shows that they increase economic losses almost everywhere.
The tipping points with the largest effects are dissociation of ocean methane hydrates and
thawing permafrost. Most of our numbers are probable underestimates, given that some tipping points, tipping point interactions,
and impact channels have not been covered in the literature so far; however, our method of structural meta-analysis means that
future modeling of climate tipping points can be integrated with relative ease, and we
present a reduced-form tipping points damage function that could be incorporated in other IAMs.

the economy is represented, different climate models result in significantly different

prices that are too low and attaches too much importance to the discount rate. Similarly we find
that omitting positive carbon cycle feedbacks leads to optimal carbon prices that are too low. We

  abstract = {We present a novel data set of subnational economic output, Gross Regional Product (GRP), for more than
1500 regions in 77 countries that allows us to empirically estimate historic climate impacts at
different time scales. Employing annual panel models, long-difference regressions and cross-sectional regressions, we
identify effects on productivity levels and productivity growth. We do not find evidence for
permanent growth rate impacts but we find robust evidence that temperature affects productivity levels considerably. An increase in
global mean surface temperature by about 3.5\textdegree{} until the end of the century would reduce global output by
7--14\% in 2100, with even higher damages in tropical and poor regions. Updating the
DICE damage function with our estimates suggests that the social cost of carbon from
temperature-induced productivity losses is on the order of 73--142$/tCO2 in 2020, rising to 92--181$/tCO2 in 2030.
These numbers exclude non-market damages and damages from extreme weather events or sea-level rise.},

warming damage assessments. But theory does not prescribe estimable forms of
this relationship. By estimating 800 plausible specifications of the
temperature-GDP relationship, we demonstrate that a wide variety of models are
statistically indistinguishable in their out-of-sample performance, including models that
exclude any temperature effect. This full set of models, however, implies a
wide range of climate change impacts by 2100, yielding considerable model uncertainty. The uncertainty
is greatest for models that specify effects of temperature on GDP growth that accumulate
over time; the 95% confidence interval that accounts for both sampling and model
uncertainty across the best-performing models ranges from 84\% GDP losses to 359\% gains.
Models of GDP levels effects yield a much narrower distribution of GDP
impacts centered around 1--3\% losses, consistent with damage functions of major integrated assessment models.
Further, models that incorporate lagged temperature effects are indicative of impacts on GDP
levels rather than GDP growth. We identify statistically significant marginal
effects of temperature on poor country GDP and agricultural production,
but not rich country GDP, non-agricultural production, or GDP growth.},

Using a capacity expansion model (CEPRO) with 31 regions, hourly time resolution, and
39 years of historical reanalysis weather data (MERRA-2), we simulate the expansion and operation of
the power sector, considering solar and wind energy as the primary source of generation.
The results suggest that zero-emissions power generation can be achieved with mostly wind and
solar energy and alternative sets of balancing technologies. We show that a high-renewables
power system can operate without significant storage and provide a high level of reliability.
Besides storage, the balancing can be achieved by a partially flexible load, expansion of power grid, and backup capacity.
The four balancing options and the level of reliability of the system are substitutes for one another,
making at least storage or backup generation optional. Most importantly, a high-renewables power system is
competitive, with the supply-side levelized system cost of electricity as low as 0.2--0.3 CNY/kWh (about 3--4 US cents per kWh)
even without consideration of further reductions in the cost of renewables.},

Applying a macro-energy IDEEA (Indian Zero Carbon Energy Pathways) model to 32 regions and 114 locations
of potential installation of wind energy and 60 locations of solar energy, we evaluated
a 100\% renewable power system in India as a concept. We considered 153 scenarios with varying sets of
generating and balancing technologies to evaluate each intermittent energy source separately and
their complementarity. Our analysis confirms the potential technical feasibility and long-term
reliability of a 100\% renewable system for India, even with solar and wind energy only.
Such a dual energy source system can potentially deliver fivefold the annual demand of 2019.
The robust, reliable supply can be achieved in the long term, as verified by 41 years of weather data.
The required expansion of energy storage and the grid will depend on the wind and solar energy structure
and the types of generating technologies. Solar energy mostly requires intraday balancing that can be
achieved through storage or demand-side flexibility. Wind energy is more seasonal and spatially scattered, and benefits
from the long-distance grid expansion for balancing. The complementarity of the two resources
on a spatial scale reduces requirements for energy storage. The demand-side flexibility is the key
in developing low-cost supply with minimum curtailments. This can be potentially achieved with the proposed
two-level electricity market where electricity prices reflect variability of the supply.
A modelled experiment with price signals demonstrates how balancing capacity depends on the price levels
of guaranteed and flexible types of loads, and therefore, can be defined by the market.},

there are enough estimates of its potential strength to now include it in our assessments.
In this paper, I present a model of the PCF and integrate this feedback in
the DICE Integrated Assessment Model to examine its consequences. I find that
doing so increases the SCC by 10--20\% in the baseline scenario,
but that this impact is much more significant in the case of a damage
function which is more reactive to very high temperature changes, and can reach
up to 220\%. It follows that setting industrial emission targets without
taking into account this feedback would lead to excessive atmospheric carbon:
I find that it increases the optimal emission control rate by circa 5\% points
on average over the period 2015--2110 and that this difference
becomes much more significant when the constraint of limiting the increase
in global mean temperature to +2\textdegree{}C or +1.5\textdegree{}C is added to the model.},

A key finding is that, under a wide range of assumptions, the risk of GIS disintegration makes a small contribution to the optimal stringency of current policy or to the overall social cost of climate change.

  abstract = {The risk of catastrophes is one of the greatest threats of climate change. Yet, conventional assumptions shared by many integrated assessment models such as DICE lead to the counterintuitive result that higher concern about climate change risks does not lead to stronger near-term abatement efforts. This paper examines whether this result still holds in a refined DICE model that employs the Epstein-Zin utility specification and that is fully coupled with a dynamic tipping point model describing the evolution of the Atlantic thermohaline circulation (THC). Risk is captured by the possibility of a future collapse of the circulation and it is nourished by fat-tailed uncertainty about climate sensitivity. This uncertainty is assumed to resolve in the middle of the second half of this century and the near-term abatement efforts, which are undertaken before that point of time, can be adjusted afterwards. These modelling choices allow posing the question of whether aversion to this specific tipping point risk has a significant effect on near-term policy efforts. The simulations, however, provide evidence that it has little effect. For the more likely climate sensitivity values, a collapse of the circulation would occur in the more distant future. In this case, acting after learning can prevent the catastrophe, implying the remarkable insensitivity of the near-term policy to risk aversion. For the rather unlikely and high climate sensitivity values, the expected damage costs are not great enough to justify taking very costly measures to safeguard the THC. Our simulations also provide some indication that risk aversion might have some effect on near-term policy, if inertia limiting the speed of decarbonisation is accounted for. As it is highly uncertain how restrictive this kind of inertia will be, future research might investigate the effects of risk aversion if additional uncertainty about inertia is considered.},

  abstract  = {Indian monsoon rainfall is vital for a large share of the
world's population. Both reliably projecting India's future precipitation
and unraveling abrupt cessations of monsoon rainfall found in
paleorecords require improved understanding of its stability properties.
While details of monsoon circulations and the associated
rainfall are complex, full-season failure is dominated by large-scale
positive feedbacks within the region. Here we find that in a
comprehensive climate model, monsoon failure is possible but very rare
under pre-industrial conditions, while under future warming it
becomes much more frequent. We identify the fundamental
intraseasonal feedbacks that are responsible for monsoon failure
in the climate model, relate these to observational data, and
build a statistically predictive model for such failure.
This model provides a simple dynamical explanation for future changes in
the frequency distribution of seasonal mean all-Indian rainfall. Forced only
by global mean temperature and the strength of the Pacific Walker
circulation in spring, it reproduces the trend as well as the
multidecadal variability in the mean and skewness of the
distribution, as found in the climate model. The approach
offers an alternative perspective on large-scale monsoon variability
as the result of internal instabilities modulated by pre-seasonal
ambient climate conditions.},

This is a new variant of the previously proposed generators, TGFSR,
modified so as to admit a Mersenne-prime period. The characteristic polynomial has many terms.
The distribution up to $\nu$ bits accuracy for $1 \le \nu \le 32$ is also shown to be good.
An algorithm is also given that checks the primitivity of the characteristic polynomial of MT with computational
complexity $O(p^2)$ where $p$ is the degree of the polynomial. We implemented this generator in portable C-code.
It passed several stringent statistical tests, including diehard. Its speed is comparable to other modern generators.
Its merits are due to the efficient algorithms that are unique to polynomial calculations over the two-element field.},

Results show that the choice of a particular metric for methane's warming potential is key to determine optimal mitigation options,

diets is more effective at reducing greenhouse gas emissions compared to carbon pricing when mitigation policies
are based on metrics that reflect methane's long-term behaviour. A combination of stringent mitigation measures and

  abstract  = {Forests are often perceived as being at the nexus of the solutions to the two main environmental crises that are
plaguing our planet today: Climate change and biodiversity loss. The EU has conceived the European Green Deal with the specific
purpose to mitigate both phenomena. The Biodiversity Strategy is a critical component to its implementation. In May 2020,
the EU Biodiversity Strategy for 2030 (COM(2020) 380) was adopted. In the text, under section 2.2.5 ("Win-win solutions for
energy generation"), there is reference to a report on the use of forest biomass for energy production by the end of 2020, and
there is an accompanying Action of the EU Bioeconomy Strategy entitled "Assessment of the EU and global biomass supply and
demand and related sustainability". We have written this report in response. In this document we cover the whole value chain
of woody biomass, from the primary wood production, to the processing and uses of wood; to its re-use and end of life. We
first describe the data arena of woody biomass for bioenergy in the EU to address the question What are the available data
sources about woody biomass for bioenergy in the EU and how can they be used for a harmonised EU-level assessment? Based on
the data sources We then explain the situation in the forest-based sector in Europe, emphasising the interlinkages between
the forest-sector industries and energy sectors. When highlighting the interactions between the forest-based industries and
the energy sector, and consequentially both the resilience and the fragility of both, certain trends emerge. From the data
we see that the overall reported uses of woody biomass are increasing. The second question we attempt to answer is: What are
the trends in the different sources of woody biomass used for bioenergy purposes? Furthermore, when digging into the available
statistics, it becomes evident that there are inconsistencies in the available data: There is a notable gap between reported
uses and sources of woody biomass. Roundwood removals estimates derived from material and energy uses indicate significant
underestimations in official removals data and the underestimated removals can be assigned to the energy sector. A follow-up
question is therefore: Why are the quantities reported as sources for woody biomass in Europe far below the quantities of
wood reported as being used in Europe? Natural disturbances followed by salvage loggings have dramatically increased in
Central Europe from 2014 to 2018, bringing significant amounts of damaged wood on the market. The oversupply of damaged wood
in the short term might distort the market by reducing wood prices and switching wood flows for energy. A fourth question we
attempt to answer is: What are the implications of natural disturbances on wood supply? The fifth question we attempt to
answer is: How can we ensure that forest management practices that are beneficial to the climate are also beneficial to biodiversity?
We assess three management practices that are associated to the demand for wood for bioenergy. Through a deep literature review,
we compare the impacts of the different management practices on both biodiversity and climate change and propose "win-win"
management practices that contribute positively to both. We also identify "lose-lose" situations whereby damage is done both
in terms of the climate and in terms of forest ecosystems. In this way we describe the field-level implications of management
to get the wood on the market in the first place.},

Warming the World: Economic Models of Global Warming, MIT press, Cambridge, MA, 2000) to allow for induced
innovation in the energy sector. Ignoring induced technological change overstates the welfare costs of
an optimal carbon tax policy by 9.4\%. However, cost savings, rather than increased environmental benefits, appear to drive the welfare gains, as the
effect of induced innovation on emissions and mean global temperature is small. Sensitivity analysis shows that potential crowding
out of other {R\&D} and market failures in the {R\&D} sector are the most important limiting factors to the potential of induced innovation.
Differences in these key assumptions explain much of the variation in the findings of other similar models.},

implemented as emissions taxes). Respectively, these measures put an additional
41.9 million and 26.7 million people at risk of hunger in 2050 compared with
the current trend scenario baseline. This highlights the need for better coordination in emissions
reduction and agricultural market management policies as well as better representation

of a carbon adder on New York's power sector. Our analysis indicates that the carbon adder gives the 'right' price signal for New York's power
generation to turn into a greener one and is shown to be more cost-effective than clean energy standards.
Requirements for permit price floors in the RGGI market induces carbon permit retirements across RGGI
states leading to small reductions in region- and country-wide emissions levels. The proposed border carbon adjustments
on electricity trade are shown to further mitigate emission leakage.},

most OECD countries put major restrictions on Russia's energy exports. Results suggest that the short-term
implications are likely to be non-trivial for EU ? Russia's largest energy export destination. Households'
real income could drop by 0.7-1.7 percent (relative to the reference case) with energy prices growing by
as much as 11 percent. But after the initial adjustment period, the cost of such restrictions for the EU
is expected to be more modest over the longer run (0.04 percent slowdown in the annual growth rate of
real income over the 2022-2030 period), even as they lead to substantial environmental co-benefits
through reductions in CO2 (6.6 percent in 2030) and air pollutant emissions (2.8-5.9 percent in 2030).
Such emission reductions would take the EU more than halfway to its Green Deal mitigation target,
reducing the necessary carbon price by around 40 EUR per tCO2. Adverse impacts on the Russian economy
would be overwhelming and, in relative terms, 10 time larger than that for EU. By 2030 the cumulative
reduction in Russian real income would exceed 1.1 trillion USD, while lost revenue from fossil fuel exports
would be almost 1.4 trillion USD.},

The GTAP LULC Data Base and its variants have been extensively used in a wide variety of applications aimed at examining the land-environment-energy nexus (Golub et al., 2012; Hertel et al., 2010; Johnson et al., 2019; Liu et al., 2014; Pe�a-L�vano et al., 2019; Stevenson et al., 2013; Taheripour et al., 2010; Taheripour & Tyner, 2012).
The first release of the GTAP LULC Data Base combines geospatial data on land use and land cover into GTAP 6 Data Base � benchmarked to year 2001 (GTAP LULC v6). The methodology for creating and using this database is well documented (Lee et al., 2009; C. Monfreda et al., 2009; Sohngen et al., 2008). Succeeding updates of the GTAP LULC Data Base (namely v7 and v8 for 2004 and v8 for 2004, 2007) relied on readily available but aggregated GTAP LULC v6, albeit using national-level data from FAOSTAT (2020) (Avetisyan et al., 2010; Baldos & Hertel, 2012). Starting with GTAP 9, LULC was created directly from the latest, high-resolution (i.e. 5-minute) spatial land cover and land use maps in combination with national-level statistics (Baldos, 2017). This memorandum documents the development of the GTAP LULC version10A which is based on the GTAP v10A Data Base for years 2004, 2007, 2011 and 2014 (Aguiar et al., 2019). This update heavily relies on the methodology for creating GTAP LULC v9 which downscales national-level land cover and crop production statistics from FAOSTAT (2020) using publicly available spatial data (see Appendix I).},

We estimate the impact of removing the gains in cereal productivity attributed to the widespread adoption of improved varieties in developing countries. Here, several different effects�higher yields, lower prices, higher land rents, and trade effects�have been incorporated in a single model of the impact of Green Revolution research (and subsequent advances in yields from crop germplasm improvement) on land-cover change. Our results generally support the Borlaug hypothesis that increases in cereal yields as a result of widespread adoption of improved crop germplasm have saved natural ecosystems from being converted to agriculture. However, this relationship is complex, and the net effect is of a much smaller magnitude than Borlaug proposed. We estimate that the total crop area in 2004 would have been between 17.9 and 26.7 million hectares larger in a world that had not benefited from crop germplasm improvement since 1965. Of these hectares, 12.0�17.7 million would have been in developing countries, displacing pastures and resulting in an estimated 2 million hectares of additional deforestation. However, the negative impacts of higher food prices on poverty and hunger under this scenario would likely have dwarfed the welfare effects of agricultural expansion.},

From the envelope condition desired stocks of durables can be calculated and investment demand for durables can be determined. For an application we choose a variable expenditure function based on the almost ideal demand specification, and evaluate alternative environmental policy measures using the equivalent variation for comparing the welfare effects.},

  abstract = {Rangelands are Earth's dominant land cover and are important providers of ecosystem services. Reliance on
rangelands is projected to grow, thus understanding the sensitivity of rangelands to future climates is
essential. We used a new ecosystem model of moderate complexity that allows, for the
first time, to quantify global changes expected in rangelands under future climates. The mean global annual
net primary production (NPP) may decline by 10~g~C~$\textnormal{m}^{-2}$~$\textnormal{year}^{-1}$ in 2050
under Representative Concentration Pathway (RCP) 8.5, but herbaceous NPP is projected to
increase slightly (i.e., average of 3~g~C~$\textnormal{m}^{-2}$~$\textnormal{year}^{-1}$).
Responses vary substantially from place-to-place, with large increases in
annual productivity projected in northern regions (e.g., a 21\% increase in productivity in
the US and Canada) and large declines in western Africa (--46\% in sub-Saharan western Africa) and
Australia (--17\%). Soil organic carbon is projected to increase in Australia (9\%), the Middle East (14\%),
and central Asia (16\%) and decline in many African savannas (e.g., --18\% in sub-Saharan western Africa).
Livestock are projected to decline 7.5 to 9.6\%, an economic loss of from \$9.7 to \$12.6~billion. Our
results suggest that forage production in Africa is sensitive to changes in climate, which will have substantial impacts
on the livelihoods of the more than 180~million people who raise livestock on those rangelands. Our
approach and the simulation tool presented here offer considerable potential for forecasting future conditions, highlight regions of concern, and
support analyses where costs and benefits of adaptations and policies may be quantified. Otherwise, the technical options
and policy and enabling environment that are needed to facilitate widespread adaptation may be very difficult to elucidate.},

to the achievement of the sustainable development goals: within this context, wise use
of land is a core challenge and concern. A key question in feeding the future world
is: how much ASF should we eat? We demonstrate that livestock raised under the circular economy
concept could provide a significant, nonnegligible part
(9--23~g/per capita) of our daily protein needs (~50--60~g/per capita).
This livestock then would not consume human-edible biomass, such as grains, but mainly convert leftovers
from arable land and grass resources into valuable food, implying that production of
livestock feed is largely decoupled from arable land. The availability of these biomass streams for livestock
then determines the boundaries for livestock production and consumption. Under this concept, the
competition for land for feed or food would be minimized and compared to no ASF,
including some ASF in the human diet could free up about one quarter of global arable land.
Our results also demonstrate that restricted growth in consumption of ASF in
Africa and Asia would be feasible under these boundary conditions, while reductions in the rest of
the world would be necessary to meet land use sustainability criteria. Managing this expansion and contraction of
future consumption of ASF is essential for achieving sustainable nutrition security.},

time of writing, the most advanced initiatives opt for a breakdown into at most
129 regions and 120 sectors. Not all existing global MRIO frameworks feature continuous time series,
margins and tax sheets, and information on reliability and uncertainty. Despite these
potential limitations, constructing a large MRIO requires significant manual labour
and many years of time. This paper describes the results from a project aimed at creating an
MRIO account that represents all countries at a detailed sectoral level, allows continuous updating, provides
information on data reliability, contains table sheets expressed in basic prices as well as all
margins and taxes, and contains a historical time series. We achieve these goals through a high level of
procedural standardisation, automation, and data organisation.},

  abstract = {The livestock sector globally is highly dynamic. In developing countries, it is evolving in response to rapidly increasing demand for livestock products. In developed countries, demand for livestock products is stagnating, while many production systems are increasing their efficiency and environmental sustainability. Historical changes in the demand for livestock products have been largely driven by human population growth, income growth and urbanization and the production response in different livestock systems has been associated with science and technology as well as increases in animal numbers. In the future, production will increasingly be affected by competition for natural resources, particularly land and water, competition between food and feed and by the need to operate in a carbon-constrained economy. Developments in breeding, nutrition and animal health will continue to contribute to increasing potential production and further efficiency and genetic gains. Livestock production is likely to be increasingly affected by carbon constraints and environmental and animal welfare legislation. Demand for livestock products in the future could be heavily moderated by socio-economic factors such as human health concerns and changing socio-cultural values. There is considerable uncertainty as to how these factors will play out in different regions of the world in the coming decades.},

  abstract = {This paper contributes to the literature on the trade liberalization � climate change nexus by investigating the impact of the current free trade agenda of the European Union (EU) on the effectiveness of a possible greenhouse gas (GHG) reduction policy for its agricultural sector. For the analysis we implement scenarios with a carbon tax on non-CO2 emissions and trade liberalization both individually and combined in CAPRI, a global partial equilibrium model for agriculture. Scenario results indicate that the simulated trade liberalization by itself has only modest effects on agricultural GHG emissions by 2030. Pricing agricultural non-CO2 emissions in the EU triggers the adoption of mitigation technologies, which contributes to emission reductions. Emission leakage, however, partially offsets the EU emission savings as production increases in less emission-efficient regions in the world. The combination of agricultural trade liberalization and carbon pricing increases emission leakage and, therefore, further undermines global mitigation gains. Our results hinge on the key assumptions that future trade agreements between non-EU countries are not considered and that the climate actions are limited to the EU only. Despite these limitations we conclude that, from a global GHG mitigation perspective, trade agreements should address emission leakage, for instance by being conditional on participating nations adopting measures directed towards GHG mitigation.},

In rich countries, there has been a strong move to decoupled subsidies and a fall in average rates of protection. In developing countries, market price support remains the dominant form of protection, and average rates of support have risen---breaking the traditional pattern of taxing agriculture. Emissions from agriculture and land use change have contributed up to a third of total greenhouse gas emissions, with beef, milk and rice production accounting for more than 80\% of agricultural emissions. Agricultural support was biased against emission-intensive goods until recent years and is now only slightly biased toward them. Although emission intensities are relatively higher in the developing countries, they have fallen far more rapidly in developing countries than in the rich countries in the past quarter century, as agricultural productivity has grown in developing countries. Policy reform will be challenging given the strong political-economy support for the current structure of protection. Increasing investments in research and development to raise productivity and lower the emissions intensity of agricultural output would help agriculture and the environment.

Plant-based meat substitutes have been identified as healthy sources of protein that, in comparison to meat, offer a number of social, environmental and health benefits and may play a role in reducing meat consumption. However, there has been a lack of research on the role they can play in the policy agenda and how specific meat substitute attributes can influence consumers to replace partially replace meat in their diets. In this paper, we examine consumers' preferences for attributes of meat and meat substitute products and develop consumer segments based on these preferences. The results of a choice experiment with 247 UK consumers, using food labels and mince (ground meat), illustrate that the type of mince, fat content, country of origin and price are major factors that influence choice. Carbon footprint, method of production and brand play a secondary role in determining consumers' choices of meat/meat substitutes. Latent class analysis is used to identify six consumer segments: price conscious, healthy eaters, taste driven, green, organic and vegetarian consumers which have different socio-demographic characteristics and meat consumption patterns. Future interventions and policies aimed at reducing meat consumption including labelling, provision of more information, financial incentives, educational campaigns and new product development will be more effective if they are holistic and target specific consumer segments, instead of focus on the average consumer.},

  abstract  = {Background. The consumption of red and processed meat has been associated with increased mortality from chronic diseases, and as a result, it has been classified by the World Health Organization as carcinogenic (processed meat) and probably carcinogenic (red meat) to humans. One policy response is to regulate red and processed meat consumption similar to other carcinogens and foods of public health concerns. Here we describe a market-based approach of taxing red and processed meat according to its health impacts. Methods We calculated economically optimal tax levels for 149 world regions that would account for (internalize) the health costs associated with ill-health from red and processed meat consumption, and we used a coupled modelling framework to estimate the impacts of optimal taxation on consumption, health costs, and non-communicable disease mortality. Health impacts were estimated using a global comparative risk assessment framework, and economic responses were estimated using international data on health costs, prices, and price elasticities. Findings. The health-related costs to society attributable to red and processed meat consumption in 2020 amounted to USD 285 billion (sensitivity intervals based on epidemiological uncertainty (SI), 93--431), three quarters of which were due to processed meat consumption. Under optimal taxation, prices for processed meat increased by 25\% on average, ranging from 1\% in low-income countries to over 100\% in high-income countries, and prices for red meat increased by 4\%, ranging from 0.2\% to over 20\%. Consumption of processed meat decreased by 16\% on average, ranging from 1\% to 25\%, whilst red meat consumption remained stable as substitution for processed meat compensated price-related reductions. The number of deaths attributable to red and processed meat consumption decreased by 9\% (222,000; SI, 38,000--357,000), and attributable health costs decreased by 14\% (USD 41 billion; SI, 10--57) globally, in each case with greatest reductions in high and middle-income countries.   Interpretation Including the social health cost of red and processed meat consumption in the price of red and processed meat could lead to significant health and environmental benefits, in particular in high and middle-income countries. The optimal tax levels estimated in this study are context-specific and can complement the simple rules of thumb currently used for setting health-motivated tax levels.},

But they also consume food edible by humans and graze on pastures that could be used for crop production. Livestock, especially ruminants, are often seen as poor converters of feed into food products. This paper analyses global livestock feed rations and feed conversion ratios, with specific insight on the diversity in production systems and feed materials. Results estimate that livestock consume 6 billion tonnes of feed (dry matter) annually--- including one third of global cereal production---of which 86 percent is made of materials that are currently not eaten by humans. In addition, soybean cakes, which production can be considered as main driver or land-use, represent 4 percent of the global livestock feed intake. Producing 1kg of boneless meat requires an average of 2.8kg human-edible feed in ruminant systems and 3.2kg in monogastric systems. While livestock is estimated to use 2.5 billion ha of land, modest improvements in feed use efficiency can reduce further expansion.},

Meanwhile, climate change is a threat to livestock production because of the impact on quality of feed crop and forage, water availability, animal and milk production, livestock diseases, animal reproduction, and biodiversity. This study reviews the global impacts of climate change on livestock production, the contribution of livestock production to climate change, and specific climate change adaptation and mitigation strategies in the livestock sector. Livestock production will be limited by climate variability as animal water consumption is expected to increase by a factor of three, demand for agricultural lands increase due to need for 70 percent growth in production, and food security concern since about one-third of the global cereal harvest is used for livestock feed. Meanwhile, the livestock sector contributes 14.5 percent of global greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions, driving further climate change. Consequently, the livestock sector will be a key player in the mitigation of GHG emissions and improving global food security. Therefore, in the transition to sustainable livestock production, there is a need for: a) assessments related to the use of adaptation and mitigation measures tailored to the location and livestock production system in use, and b) policies that support and facilitate the implementation of climate change adaptation and mitigation measures.},

  abstract = {Abstract The taxation of Greenhouse Gases (GHG) represents an efficient means of achieving climate change mitigation, and this is often the starting point in any discussion of long run global GHG reduction. However, the direct effects of such a tax, or equivalently, an emissions trading scheme, will vary across countries and sectors according to the emissions intensity of the sector. We report, for the first time, estimates of such livestock emissions intensities for all regions of the world and decompose the intensities to understand the sources of regional variation. Our findings indicate that most of the variation is due to differences in the value of output per animal in different regions, which in turn is due to regional differences in output per animal (yield) and dollar per unit output (price). Animals with relatively low annual output values tend to be characterized by higher economic emissions intensities. We find this to be the case in many developing countries. Livestock activity in these high emissions intensity regions are hit especially hard by an emissions tax, resulting in disproportionate reductions in output and consumption in many regions already suffering from malnutrition.},

We identify a preliminary global target for reducing emissions from agriculture of $\sim 1$~$\textnormal{GtCO}_2\textnormal{e}$ $\textnormal{yr}^{-1}$ by 2030 to limit warming in 2100 to 2~\textdegree{}C above pre-industrial levels. Yet plausible agricultural development pathways with mitigation cobenefits deliver only 21--40\% of needed mitigation. The target indicates that more transformative technical and policy options will be needed, such as methane inhibitors and finance for new practices. A more comprehensive target for the 2~\textdegree{}C limit should be developed to include soil carbon and agriculture-related mitigation options. Excluding agricultural emissions from mitigation targets and plans will increase the cost of mitigation in other sectors or reduce the feasibility of meeting the 2~\textdegree{}C limit.},

Global greenhouse gas emissions continue to climb, meaning increasingly stringent climate policies are needed if we are to meet the Paris Agreement targets. However, policies that curtail emissions in one region might increase emissions in another through the transfer of emission-intensive production across borders. Such spillover of emissions, mostly via international trade, can cause what is referred to as "carbon leakage." This primer first provides an overview of the underlying mechanisms, empirical evaluation, and future projections of carbon leakage. It then illustrates potential anti-leakage policies, including free allocation of emission permits and border carbon adjustment. Well-designed anti-leakage policies that create economic and environmental benefits and ensure fairness and justice are clearly required. The 2050 net-zero commitments announced by over 100 nations offers an opportunity to form a climate club with common border measures to prevent carbon leakage while incentivizing ambitious climate actions.},

  abstract = {Implementation of CBAM to support EU climate neutrality by 2050 has raised several concerns. As the mechanism aims to minimise leakage through equal fairness in global mitigation, imposing carbon tariffs on the EU's imports of energy-intensive goods could curtail the export of EU trading partners. This might be detrimental, especially to the LDCs, due to their high exposures and vulnerability risks. This paper assesses and quantifies the implication of EU-CBAM and analyses eight complementary measures to mitigate the impacts on LDCs. Scenario developments are constructed by projecting the EU’s new climate targets relative to the reference scenario of the EU's current policies. A more stringent climate target results in carbon leakage, and implementing CBAM will reduce the rate by one-third by 2040. The analysis also confirms significant welfare loss for LDCs through declining exports. Exempting LDCs from EU CBAM is less justifiable, as this measure results in greater leakage than other options. A further assessment confirms that policy recommendation for CBAM complementary measures should focus on the climate transformation pathway for LDCs. EU CBAM implementation with revenue-redistribution targeted to promote clean and efficient use of energy in LDCs has improved the welfare of recipient countries, substantially reduced leakage, and proven cost-efficient for the EU.},

Welfare effects are measured as Compensation Variation (CV) for multiple price changes where Hicksian cross price elasticities, household expenditures and price changes are included in the calculations. Results show that taxes on meat are almost neutral over households when expenditures on meat are used as welfare indicators, and regressive if income is used. This can be explained by the households' similar shares of total expenditures on meat. The households with the smallest income levels need to be compensated with 904 SEK per person and year (equivalent to Euro 86.6 per year in the year 2009 exchange rate) to feel that utility is not lowered if taxes on meat are introduced, and the households with the highest income levels need to be compensated with 1141 SEK (Euro 109.3) per person and year. For the year 2009 these compensations correspond to 0.74\% and 0.78\% of total expenditures for the low and high income group, respectively. When instead comparing the compensation with income levels, the effects correspond to 0.99\% for the households with the smallest income levels and to 0.51\% for the households with the largest income.},

An online questionnaire was completed by an opportunistic sample of 655 people aged 18�82 who were registered on the MFM website, and were meat eaters at the time of registering. The key focus of quantitative analyses was comparisons between three groups: those who described themselves as �omnivores� who ate all meat at the time of completing the survey, those who ate only some meat, and those who had stopped eating meat since registering for MFM. The qualitative component entailed Interpretative Phenomenological Analysis of in-depth interviews with 18 people who had completed the questionnaire. The quantitative data revealed that people who had stopped eating meat since engaging with the MFM campaign had more positive attitudes toward being vegetarian or vegan, had been engaged with MFM for a longer time, and had used more elements of the MFM website. The qualitative data illustrated that individuals understood and appreciated MFM's aim of supporting people to make an initial change and then considering expanding on this. Interviewees highlighted the value and importance of campaign materials that helped them to turn their beliefs and motivation into enduring behaviour change. The observed associations between longer engagement with the campaign and greater behaviour change suggest that MFM and similar campaigns will maximise their impact if they can maintain people's active engagement: that this will necessitate deeper understanding of the forms of support and advice are most wanted and most effective.},

A multivariate regression analysis with survey data from soldiers indicate that those who have experienced meat free days in the military kitchen are more prone to claim that joining the military has given them a more positive view on vegetarian food. Furthermore, the survey gives evidence that stated willingness to eat more vegetarian food is higher among soldiers who believe in the environmental and health benefits of meat reduction.},

This global implicit subsidy to CO2 emissions totals several hundred billion dollars annually. The greater protection of downstream industries, which are relatively clean, substantially accounts for this pattern. The downstream pattern can be explained by theories where industries lobby for low tariffs on their inputs but final consumers are poorly organized. A quantitative general equilibrium model suggests that if countries applied similar trade policies to clean and dirty goods, global CO2 emissions would decrease and global real income would change little.}},

Background
Sustainable diets are intended to address the increasing health and environmental concerns related to food production and consumption. Although many candidates for sustainable diets have emerged, a consistent and joint environmental and health analysis of these diets has not been done at a regional level. Using an integrated health and environmental modelling framework for more than 150 countries, we examined three different approaches to sustainable diets motivated by environmental, food security, and public health objectives.
Methods
In this global modelling analysis, we combined analyses of nutrient levels, diet-related and weight-related chronic disease mortality, and environmental impacts for more than 150 countries in three sets of diet scenarios. The first set, based on environmental objectives, replaced 25�100\% of animal-source foods with plant-based foods. The second set, based on food security objectives, reduced levels of underweight, overweight, and obesity by 25�100\%. The third set, based on public health objectives, consisted of four energy-balanced dietary patterns: flexitarian, pescatarian, vegetarian, and vegan. In the nutrient analysis, we calculated nutrient intake and changes in adequacy based on international recommendations and a global dataset of nutrient content and supply. In the health analysis, we estimated changes in mortality using a comparative risk assessment with nine diet and weight-related risk factors. In the environmental analysis, we combined country-specific and food group-specific footprints for greenhouse gas emissions, cropland use, freshwater use, nitrogen application, and phosphorus application to analyse the relationship between the health and environmental impacts of dietary change.
Findings
Following environmental objectives by replacing animal-source foods with plant-based ones was particularly effective in high-income countries for improving nutrient levels, lowering premature mortality (reduction of up to 12\% [95\% CI 10�13] with complete replacement), and reducing some environmental impacts, in particular greenhouse gas emissions (reductions of up to 84\%). However, it also increased freshwater use (increases of up to 16\%) and had little effectiveness in countries with low or moderate consumption of animal-source foods. Following food-security objectives by reducing underweight and overweight led to similar reductions in premature mortality (reduction of up to 10\% [95\% CI 9�11]), and moderately improved nutrient levels. However, it led to only small reductions in environmental impacts at the global level (all impacts changed by <15\%), with reduced impacts in high-income and middle-income countries, and increased resource use in low-income countries. Following public health objectives by adopting energy-balanced, low-meat dietary patterns that are in line with available evidence on healthy eating led to an adequate nutrient supply for most nutrients, and large reductions in premature mortality (reduction of 19\% [95\% CI 18�20] for the flexitarian diet to 22\% [18�24] for the vegan diet). It also markedly reduced environmental impacts globally (reducing greenhouse gas emissions by 54�87\%, nitrogen application by 23�25\%, phosphorus application by 18�21\%, cropland use by 8�11\%, and freshwater use by 2�11\%) and in most regions, except for some environmental domains (cropland use, freshwater use, and phosphorus application) in low-income countries.
Interpretation
Approaches for sustainable diets are context specific and can result in concurrent reductions in environmental and health impacts globally and in most regions, particularly in high-income and middle-income countries, but they can also increase resource use in low-income countries when diets diversify. A public health strategy focused on improving energy balance and dietary changes towards predominantly plant-based diets that are in line with evidence on healthy eating is a suitable approach for sustainable diets. Updating national dietary guidelines to reflect the latest evidence on healthy eating can by itself be important for improving health and reducing environmental impacts and can complement broader and more explicit criteria of sustainability.

Although a quantification of the net impacts of climate change on the livestock sector is beyond the reach of our current understanding, there is strong evidence that there will be impacts throughout the supply chain, from farm production to processing operations, storage, transport, retailing and human consumption. The risks of climate-related impacts are highly context-specific but expected to be higher in environments that are already hot and have limited socio-economic and institutional resources for adaptation. Large uncertainties remain as to climate futures and the exposure and responses of the interlinked human and natural systems to climatic changes over time. Consequently, adaptation choices will need to account for a wide range of possible futures, including those with low probability but large consequences.},

Those SSA tools assume that all parameters or shocks are varying independently (i.e., the distributions of all parameters or shocks are uncorrelated) or together (i.e., are completely correlated). The techniques in this paper remove those restrictions. However, users need to make small modifications to the TAB file for the model. Different modifications are needed for different SSA scenarios.
Further, the standard SSA procedure built into RunGTAP and RunGEM allows you to compute the sensitivity of model results either with respect to variations in parameter values or with respect to variations in shock values, but you cannot vary both parameters and shocks at the same time. Our discussion concentrates on the parameter case. However, we later show how shock variation may be modelled as a type of parameter variation. This opens the door to simultaneous variation of shocks and parameters.
We include worked examples of the techniques described, based on the standard GTAP Model.},

  abstract = {Abstract In response to the invasion of Ukraine, most OECD countries have announced punishing sanctions against Russia. In addition to targeting financial markets and service sectors, some countries have begun to impose restrictions on exports of Russia's fossil fuels. We analyse a scenario whereby most OECD countries put major restrictions on Russia's energy exports. The short-term implications are likely to be non-trivial for the EU – Russia's largest energy export destination. Households' real income could drop by 0.7 to 1.7 percent (relative to the reference case) with energy prices growing by as much as 11 percent. But in the longer run, the cost of such restrictions for the EU is expected to be more modest (0.04 percent slowdown in the annual growth rate of real income over the 2022–2030 period), even as they lead to substantial environmental benefits reducing CO2 (6.6 percent in 2030) and air pollutant emissions (2.8 to 5.9 percent in 2030). Such emission reductions would take the EU more than halfway to its Green Deal mitigation target, reducing the necessary carbon price by around 40 EUR per tCO2. Adverse impacts on the Russian economy would be overwhelming and, in relative terms, 10 time larger than that for EU.},

We uncover a U-shaped relationship where extreme cold and hot temperatures increase mortality rates,

adaptation to local climate. Using a revealed-preference approach to recover unobserved adaptation costs, we
estimate that the mean global increase in mortality risk due to climate change, accounting for
adaptation benefits and costs, is valued at roughly 3.2\% of global GDP in 2100 under a
high-emissions scenario. Notably, today's cold locations are projected to benefit, while today's poor and
hot locations have large projected damages. Finally, our central estimates indicate that the release
of an additional ton of CO2 today will cause mortality-related damages of \$36.6 under a high-emissions scenario,
with an interquartile range accounting for both econometric and climate uncertainty of
[-\$7.8, \$73.0]. These empirically grounded estimates exceed the previous literature's estimates by

  abstract = {Estimates of global economic damage caused by carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions can inform climate
policy. The social cost of carbon (SCC) quantifies these damages by characterizing how additional CO2 emissions
today impact future economic outcomes through altering the climate. Previous estimates have suggested that large,
warming-driven increases in energy expenditures could dominate the SCC, but they rely on
models that are spatially coarse and not tightly linked to data. Here we show that the release of one ton of CO2
today is projected to reduce total future energy expenditures, with most estimates valued between -US$3 and -US$1,
depending on discount rates. Our results are based on an architecture that integrates global data,
econometrics and climate science to estimate local damages worldwide. Notably, we project that emerging
economies in the tropics will dramatically increase electricity consumption owing to warming, which
requires critical infrastructure planning. However, heating reductions in colder countries offset this
increase globally. We estimate that 2099 annual�global electricity consumption increases by about
4.5~exajoules (7 per cent of current global consumption)�per one-degree-Celsius increase in global mean
surface�temperature (GMST), whereas direct consumption of other fuels declines by about
11.3~exajoules (7 per cent of current global consumption) per one-degree-Celsius�increase in GMST.
Our finding of net savings contradicts previous research, because global data indicate that many populations
will remain too poor for most of the twenty-first century to substantially increase energy
consumption in response to warming. Importantly, damage estimates would differ if poorer populations
were given greater weight},

current climate trends. Hsiang et al. collected national data
documenting the responses in six economic sectors to short-term weather fluctuations.
These data were integrated with probabilistic distributions from a set of global climate
models and used to estimate future costs during the remainder of this century across a
range of scenarios (see the Perspective by Pizer). In terms of overall effects on gross
domestic product, the authors predict negative impacts in the southern United States and
positive impacts in some parts of the Pacific Northwest and New England. Science, this issue p. 1362; see also p. 1330 One percent of gross domestic product per degree Celsius is a steep price to pay for climate change. Estimates of climate change damage are central to the design of climate policies. Here, we develop a flexible architecture for computing damages that integrates climate science, econometric analyses, and process models. We use this approach to construct spatially explicit, probabilistic, and empirically derived estimates of economic damage in the United States from climate change. The combined value of market and nonmarket damage across analyzed sectors—agriculture, crime, coastal storms, energy, human mortality, and labor—increases quadratically in global mean temperature, costing roughly 1.2\% of gross domestic product per +1°C on average. Importantly, risk is distributed unequally across locations, generating a large transfer of value northward and westward that increases economic inequality. By the late 21st century, the poorest third of counties are projected to experience damages between 2 and 20\% of county income (90\% chance) under business-as-usual emissions (Representative Concentration Pathway 8.5).},

Importantly, we demonstrate that the Envelope Theorem implies the marginal product of a long-run climate can be exactly identified using only idiosyncratic weather variation. We apply this method to the temperature climate of the modern United States and find that, despite evidence that populations adapt, the marginal product of temperature has remained unchanged during 1970-2010, with high temperatures having low net value. Integrating marginal products recovers a value function for temperature, describing the causal effect of non-marginal climate changes net of adaptive re-optimization. We use this value function to consider the influence of temperature in the current cross-section and a future climate change scenario.},

Due to limited data availability, previous meta-analyses of global climate damages potentially suffered from multiple sources of coefficient and standard error bias: duplicate estimates, omitted variables, measurement error, overreliance on published estimates, dependent errors, and heteroskedasticity. To address and test for these biases, we expand on previous datasets to obtain sufficient degrees of freedom to make the necessary model adjustments, including dropping duplicate estimates and including methodological variables. Estimating the relationship between temperature and climate damages using weighted least squares with cluster-robust standard errors, we find strong evidence that duplicate and omitted variable biases flatten the relationship. However, the magnitude of the bias greatly depends on the treatment of speculative high-temperature (>4{\^A}�{\$}{\$}^{\{}{\backslash}circ {\}}{\$}{\$}C) damage estimates. Replacing the DICE-2013R damage function with our preferred estimate of the temperature{\^a}{\texteuro}``damage relationship, we find a three- to four-fold increase in the 2015 SCC relative to DICE, depending on the treatment of productivity.

Moreover, the ultimate global costs to coastal resources will depend strongly on adaptation, society{\^a}{\texteuro}{\texttrademark}s response to cope with the local impacts. This paper presents a new open-source optimization model to assess global coastal impacts from SLR from the perspective of economic efficiency. The Coastal Impact and Adaptation Model (CIAM) determines the optimal strategy for adaptation at the local level, evaluating over 12,000 coastal segments, as described in the DIVA database (Vafeidis et al. 2006), based on their socioeconomic characteristics and the potential impacts of relative sea level rise and uncertain sea level extremes. A deterministic application of CIAM demonstrates the model{\^a}{\texteuro}{\texttrademark}s ability to assess local impacts and direct costs, choose the least-cost adaptation, and estimate global net damages for several climate scenarios that account for both global and local components of SLR (Kopp et al. 2014). CIAM finds that there is large potential for coastal adaptation to reduce the expected impacts of SLR compared to the alternative of no adaptation, lowering global net present costs through 2100 by a factor of seven to less than {\$}1.7 trillion, although this does not include initial transition costs to overcome an under-adapted current state. In addition to producing aggregate estimates, CIAM results can also be interpreted at the local level, where retreat (e.g., relocate inland) is often a more cost-effective adaptation strategy than protect (e.g., construct physical defenses).},

This full set of models, however, implies a wide range of climate change impacts by 2100, yielding considerable model uncertainty. The uncertainty is greatest for models that specify effects of temperature on GDP growth that accumulate over time; the 95% confidence interval that accounts for both sampling and model uncertainty across the best-performing models ranges from 84% GDP losses to 359% gains. Models of GDP levels effects yield a much narrower distribution of GDP impacts centered around 1–3% losses, consistent with damage functions of major integrated assessment models. Further, models that incorporate lagged temperature effects are indicative of impacts on GDP levels rather than GDP growth. We identify statistically significant marginal effects of temperature on poor country GDP and agricultural production, but not rich country GDP, non-agricultural production, or GDP growth.},

The integrated assessment framework is valuable because it represents socioeconomic and energy system changes that will be important for understanding building energy expenditures in the future. Results indicate that changes in net expenditures are not uniform across the globe. Net expenditures decrease in some regions, such as Canada and Russia, where heating demands currently dominate, and increase the most in areas with less demand for space heating and greater demand for space cooling.

However, the health benefits of climate mitigation, as included in the policy assessment process, have been estimated without much input from health experts. Objectives: In accordance with recommendations from the National Academies in a 2017 report on approaches to update the social cost of greenhouse gases (SC-GHG), an expert panel of 26 health researchers and climate economists gathered for a virtual technical workshop in May 2021 to conduct a systematic review and meta-analysis and recommend improvements to the estimation of health impacts in economic-climate models. Methods: Regionally resolved effect estimates of unit increases in temperature on net all-cause mortality risk were generated through random-effects pooling of studies identified through a systematic review. Results: Effect estimates and associated uncertainties varied by global region, but net increases in mortality risk associated with increased average annual temperatures (ranging from 0.1\% to 1.1\% per 1°C) were estimated for all global regions. Key recommendations for the development and utilization of health damage modules were provided by the expert panel and included the following: not relying on individual methodologies in estimating health damages; incorporating a broader range of cause-specific mortality impacts; improving the climate parameters available in economic models; accounting for socioeconomic trajectories and adaptation factors when estimating health damages; and carefully considering how air pollution impacts should be incorporated in economic-climate models. Conclusions: This work provides an example of how subject-matter experts can work alongside climate economists in making continued improvements to SC-GHG estimates.},

Here, we link a probabilistic framework for sea-level projections to a small ensemble of Antarctic ice-sheet (AIS) simulations incorporating these physical processes to explore their influence on global-mean sea-level (GMSL) and relative sea-level (RSL). We compare the new projections to past results using expert assessment and structured expert elicitation about AIS changes. Under high greenhouse gas emissions (Representative Concentration Pathway [RCP] 8.5), median projected 21st century GMSL rise increases from 79 to 146 cm. Without protective measures, revised median RSL projections would by 2100 submerge land currently home to 153 million people, an increase of 44 million. The use of a physical model, rather than simple parameterizations assuming constant acceleration of ice loss, increases forcing sensitivity: overlap between the central 90\% of simulations for 2100 for RCP 8.5 (93–243 cm) and RCP 2.6 (26–98 cm) is minimal. By 2300, the gap between median GMSL estimates for RCP 8.5 and RCP 2.6 reaches >10 m, with median RSL projections for RCP 8.5 jeopardizing land now occupied by 950 million people (versus 167 million for RCP 2.6). The minimal correlation between the contribution of AIS to GMSL by 2050 and that in 2100 and beyond implies current sea-level observations cannot exclude future extreme outcomes. The sensitivity of post-2050 projections to deeply uncertain physics highlights the need for robust decision and adaptive management frameworks.},

GSL rose at 0.1 ± 0.1 mm/y (2σ) over 0–700 CE. A GSL fall of 0.2 ± 0.2 mm/y over 1000–1400 CE is associated with ∼0.2 °C global mean cooling. A significant GSL acceleration began in the 19th century and yielded a 20th century rise that is extremely likely (probability P≥0.95) faster than during any of the previous 27 centuries. A semiempirical model calibrated against the GSL reconstruction indicates that, in the absence of anthropogenic climate change, it is extremely likely (P=0.95) that 20th century GSL would have risen by less than 51\% of the observed 13.8±1.5 cm. The new semiempirical model largely reconciles previous differences between semiempirical 21st century GSL projections and the process model-based projections summarized in the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change’s Fifth Assessment Report.},

  abstract = {Welfare losses from climate change in agriculture will mainly affect consumers, particularly in the low-latitude regions. Climate change threatens agricultural productivity worldwide, resulting in higher food prices. Associated economic gains and losses differ not only by region but also between producers and consumers and are affected by market dynamics. On the basis of an impact modeling chain, starting with 19 different climate projections that drive plant biophysical process simulations and ending with agro-economic decisions, this analysis focuses on distributional effects of high-end climate change impacts across geographic regions and across economic agents. By estimating the changes in surpluses of consumers and producers, we find that climate change can have detrimental impacts on global agricultural welfare, especially after 2050, because losses in consumer surplus generally outweigh gains in producer surplus. Damage in agriculture may reach the annual loss of 0.3\% of future total gross domestic product at the end of the century globally, assuming further opening of trade in agricultural products, which typically leads to interregional production shifts to higher latitudes. Those estimated global losses could increase substantially if international trade is more restricted. If beneficial effects of atmospheric carbon dioxide fertilization can be realized in agricultural production, much of the damage could be avoided. Although trade policy reforms toward further liberalization help alleviate climate change impacts, additional compensation mechanisms for associated environmental and development concerns have to be considered.},

This paper aims to quantify the role of market-mediated adjustments in attenuating the effects of climate change by allowing the expression of the new climate-induced pattern of comparative advantages within and between countries. To do this, we develop a quantitative general equilibrium trade model where the representation of land use choice is inspired from modern Ricardian trade models. We use spatially explicit information from the agronomic literature about potential yields before and after climate change for calibration and counterfactual simulations. The results show that the climate-induced yield changes generate large price movements that incentivize adjustments in production and trade. Both production and trade adjustments contribute to reducing welfare losses globally, with production adjustments making the larger contribution.},

Whether and how one accounts for human adaptation directly affects estimates of the economic consequences of environmental change, estimates that are both critical in informing policy decisions and notoriously difficult to value. This paper introduces and applies an analytical framework for placing an economic value on adaptation. We explore the issue first in a stylized model that facilitates making concrete generalizations about the kinds of adaptations that generate high or low economic value. We then test the soundness of our insights by incorporating learning and adaptive decision-making into a structural dynamic forestry model where climate change is imposed exogenously and agents respond optimally. Using downscaled climate projections integrated with site- and species-specific timber productivity data, we estimate the economic value of adaptation to climate change within the California timber industry. We find on the intensive margin, changing the rotation intervals will yield a low value of adaptation, but on the extensive margin, replanting more suitable tree species can yield significant value.},

In order to evaluate the aggregate and local economic consequences of higher temperatures, we propose a dynamic economic assessment model of the world economy with high spatial resolution. Our model features a number of mechanisms through which individuals can adapt to global warming, including costly trade and migration, and local technological innovations and natality rates. We quantify the model at a 1� � 1� resolution and estimate damage functions that determine the impact of temperature changes on a region�s fundamental productivity and amenities depending on local temperatures. Our baseline results show welfare losses as large as 15% in parts of Africa and Latin America but also high heterogeneity across locations, with northern regions in Siberia, Canada, and Alaska experiencing gains. Our results indicate large uncertainty about average welfare effects and point to migration and, to a lesser extent, innovation as important adaptation mechanisms. We use the model to assess the impact of carbon taxes, abatement technologies, and clean energy subsidies. Carbon taxes delay consumption of fossil fuels and help flatten the temperature curve but are much more effective when an abatement technology is forthcoming.},

The analysis of their structure is critical for evaluating their potential efficiency in understanding the Nexus, which will be particularly effective for gauging the importance of the topic, the reciprocal dependency of its elements and the expected macroeconomic, demographic and climatic pressures that will act on its components. General equilibrium models can be useful devices to this end, as they are specifically built to track interdependencies and transmission effects across sectors and countries. Nevertheless, the review showed that most CGEs in the literature struggle to represent the competing water uses across sectors and, in particular, those concerning the energy sector. Therefore, it highlights the need to resolve this issue as a necessary step toward improving future research.},

Economic assessments of climate change risks are intended to be comprehensive, covering the full range of physical impacts and their associated market and non-market costs, considering the greater vulnerability of poor people and the challenges of adaptation. Available estimates still fall significantly short of this goal, but alternative approaches that have been proposed attempt to address these gaps. This review seeks to provide a common basis for natural scientists, social scientists, and modellers to understand the research challenges involved in evaluating the economic risks of climate change. Focusing on the estimation processes embedded in economic integrated assessment models and the concerns raised in the literature, we summarise the frontiers of research relevant to improving quantitative damage estimates, representing the full complexity of the associated systems, and evaluating the impact of the various economic assumptions used to manage this complexity.},

The economic consequences of many of the complex risks associated with climate change cannot, however, currently be quantified. Here we argue that these unquantified, poorly understood and often deeply uncertain risks can and should be included in economic evaluations and decision-making processes. We present an overview of these unquantified risks and an ontology of them founded on the reasons behind their lack of robust evaluation. These consist of risks missing owing to delays in sharing knowledge and expertise across disciplines, spatial and temporal variations of climate impacts, feedbacks and interactions between risks, deep uncertainty in our knowledge, and currently unidentified risks. We highlight collaboration needs within and between the natural and social science communities to address these gaps. We also provide an approach for integrating assessments or speculations of these risks in a way that accounts for interdependencies, avoids double counting and makes assumptions clear. Multiple paths exist for engaging with these missing risks, with both model-based quantification and non-model-based qualitative assessments playing crucial roles. A wide range of climate impacts are understudied or challenging to quantify, and are missing from current evaluations of the climate risks to lives and livelihoods. Strong interdisciplinary collaboration and deeper engagement with uncertainty is needed to properly inform policymakers and the public about climate risks.},

  abstract = {Abstract Land-based climate mitigation measures have gained significant attention and importance in public and private sector climate policies. Building on previous studies, we refine and update the mitigation potentials for 20 land-based measures in >200 countries and five regions, comparing “bottom-up” sectoral estimates with integrated assessment models (IAMs). We also assess implementation feasibility at the country level. Cost-effective (available up to \$100/tCO2eq) land-based mitigation is 8–13.8 GtCO2eq yr−1 between 2020 and 2050, with the bottom end of this range representing the IAM median and the upper end representing the sectoral estimate. The cost-effective sectoral estimate is about 40\% of available technical potential and is in line with achieving a 1.5°C pathway in 2050. Compared to technical potentials, cost-effective estimates represent a more realistic and actionable target for policy. The cost-effective potential is approximately 50\% from forests and other ecosystems, 35\% from agriculture, and 15\% from demand-side measures. The potential varies sixfold across the five regions assessed (0.75–4.8 GtCO2eq yr−1) and the top 15 countries account for about 60\% of the global potential. Protection of forests and other ecosystems and demand-side measures present particularly high mitigation efficiency, high provision of co-benefits, and relatively lower costs. The feasibility assessment suggests that governance, economic investment, and socio-cultural conditions influence the likelihood that land-based mitigation potentials are realized. A substantial portion of potential (80\%) is in developing countries and LDCs, where feasibility barriers are of greatest concern. Assisting countries to overcome barriers may result in significant quantities of near-term, low-cost mitigation while locally achieving important climate adaptation and development benefits. Opportunities among countries vary widely depending on types of land-based measures available, their potential co-benefits and risks, and their feasibility. Enhanced investments and country-specific plans that accommodate this complexity are urgently needed to realize the large global potential from improved land stewardship.},

developed for the climate modeling community as a basis for long-term and near-term modeling experiments. The four RCPs together span the
range of year 2100 radiative forcing values found in the open literature, i.e. from 2.6 to 8.5~W/m2. The RCPs are the product of an innovative
collaboration between integrated assessment modelers, climate modelers, terrestrial ecosystem modelers and emission inventory experts.
The resulting product forms a comprehensive data set with high spatial and sectoral resolutions for the period extending to 2100.
Land use and emissions of air pollutants and greenhouse gases are reported mostly at a $0.5 \times 0.5$ degree spatial resolution,
with air pollutants also provided per sector (for well-mixed gases, a coarser resolution is used). The underlying integrated
assessment model outputs for land use, atmospheric emissions and concentration data were harmonized across models and scenarios to
ensure consistency with historical observations while preserving individual scenario trends. For most variables, the RCPs cover a
wide range of the existing literature. The RCPs are supplemented with extensions (Extended Concentration Pathways, ECPs), which allow
climate modeling experiments through the year 2300. The RCPs are an important development in climate research and provide a potential
foundation for further research and assessment, including emissions mitigation and impact analysis.},

  abstract  = {Although hot spells and heat waves are considered extreme meteorological phenomena, the statistical theory of extreme values has only rarely, if ever, been applied. To address this shortcoming, we extended the point process approach to extreme value analysis to model the frequency, duration, and intensity of hot spells. The annual frequency of hot spells was modeled by a Poisson distribution, and their length by a geometric distribution. To account for the temporal dependence of daily maximum temperatures within a hot spell, the excesses over a high threshold were modeled by a conditional generalized Pareto distribution, whose scale parameter depends on the excess on the previous day. Requiring only univariate extreme value theory, our proposed approach is simple enough to be readily generalized to incorporate trends in hot spell characteristics. Through a heat wave simulator, the statistical modeling of hot spells can be extended to apply to more fullfledged heat waves, which are difficult to model directly. Our statistical model for hot spells was fitted to time series of daily maximum temperature during the summer heat wave season in Phoenix, Arizona (USA), Fort Collins, Colorado (USA), and Paris, France. Trends in the frequency, duration, and intensity of hot spells were fitted as well. The heat wave simulator was used to convert any such trends into the corresponding changes in the characteristics of heat waves. By being based at least in part on extreme value theory, our proposed approach is both more realistic and more flexible than techniques heretofore applied to model hot spells and heat waves.},

there are no pre-determined dimensions. The new utility has additional features compared
to the original FORTRAN code: (1) it includes 10 new statistical distributions;
(2) it has four additional output formats; and (3) it has an alternative random
number generator. This guide provides a summary of the full features of the LHS utility.

  abstract    = {First version September 1996, revised in November 2000
In economic simulation, results often hinge crucially on values of key exogenous inputs (the values of the parameters of the model and the shocks applied). Computational burden has, in the past, hindered systematic investigation of the impacts of variations in these key exogenous inputs. In this document, practical methods for conducting systematic sensitivity analysis for any model implemented using the GEMPACK suite of software are documented.
The procedures described here are based on GTAP Technical Paper number 2 which sets out the theory behind the Gaussian quadrature methods on which the automated procedure is based. The procedures allow modellers to obtain estimates of the means and standard deviations of any endogenous variables of their model. The model only needs to be solved a relatively modest number of times (usually only 2N times if N exogenous inputs are varying); this is considerably fewer than the number of solves required by Monte Carlo methods. The procedure documented here fully automates solving the model as often as is necessary; once the user sets it up and starts it running, no further intervention is required.
The document spells out the assumptions which must be made about the distribution of the exogenous inputs for the methods described to be valid.
Five examples of systematic sensitivity computations are presented and the accompanying software allows modellers to work through these examples while reading the document.
This should leave readers fully prepared to analyse the sensitivity of results for any model implemented in GEMPACK.
<b>Note Added November 2000:</b>
The Windows programs RunGTAP and RunGEM now provide much easier ways of carrying out systematic sensitivity calculations than those supplied with this Technical Paper.  If unsure, please contact <a href="mailto:support@gempack.com.au">support@gempack.com.au</a>.},

  abstract  = {Climate change by its very nature epitomizes the necessity and usefulness of the global-to-local-to-global (GLG) paradigm. It is a global problem with the potential to affect local communities and ecosystems. Accumulation of local impacts and responses to climate change feeds back to regional and global systems creating feedback loops. Understanding these complex impacts and interactions is key to developing more resilient adaptation measures and designing more efficient mitigation policies. To this date, however, GLG interactions have not yet been an integrative part of the decision-support toolkit. The typical approach either traces the impacts of global action on the local level or estimates the implications of local policies at the global scale. The first approach misses cumulative feedback of local responses that can have regional, national or global impacts. In the second case, one undermines a global context of the local actions most likely misrepresenting the complexity of the local decision-making process. Potential interactions across scales are further complicated by the presence of cascading impacts, connected risks and tipping points. Capturing these dimensions is not always a straightforward task and often requires a departure from conventional modeling approaches. In this paper, we review the state-of-the-art approaches to modeling GLG interactions in the context of climate change. We further identify key limitations that drive the lack of GLG coupling cases and discuss what could be done to address these challenges.},

  abstract = {Sea-level rise and associated flood hazards pose severe risks to the millions of people globally living in coastal zones. Models representing coastal adaptation and impacts are important tools to inform the design of strategies to manage these risks. Representing the often deep uncertainties influencing these risks poses nontrivial challenges. A common uncertainty characterization approach is to use a few benchmark cases to represent the range and relative probabilities of the set of possible outcomes. This has been done in coastal adaptation studies, for example, by using low, moderate, and high percentiles of an input of interest, like sea-level changes. A key consideration is how this simplified characterization of uncertainty influences the distributions of estimated coastal impacts. Here, we show that using only a few benchmark percentiles to represent uncertainty in future sea-level change can lead to overconfident projections and underestimate high-end risks as compared to using full ensembles for sea-level change and socioeconomic parametric uncertainties. When uncertainty in future sea level is characterized by low, moderate, and high percentiles of global mean sea-level rise, estimates of high-end (95th percentile) damages are underestimated by between 18% (SSP1-2.6) and 46% (SSP5-8.5). Additionally, using the 5th and 95th percentiles of sea-level scenarios underestimates the 5-95% width of the distribution of adaptation costs by a factor ranging from about two to four, depending on SSP-RCP pathway. The resulting underestimation of the uncertainty range in adaptation costs can bias adaptation and mitigation decision-making.},

Emissions, as a result of environmental taxation, fall through reduced output, production factor substitution, and increased end of pipe abatement activity. The analysis shows that a full internalisation of environmental externalities can result in modest overall economic and environmental welfare gains. There are, however, differences in terms of employment and output, depending on what combination of taxes are applied, which sectors are covered, and how fiscal revenues are redistributed. Air quality benefits range from €35–75 per ton of CO2 abated. Total environmental benefits always exceed GDP loss and the associated welfare loss.},

Otherwise the change must come purely through a reduction in demand. Our analysis shows that the cost of environmental policy is considerably overestimated by top-down models if a bottom-up abatement cost curve is not included. Using the data for the Swiss economy, we demonstrate two techniques of representing an abatement function explicitly in a computable general equilibrium model: a traditional and a hybrid (discrete technology modeling) approach. The results suggest that the current climate policy in Switzerland will not be able to move the economy towards the required 10% CO2 reduction. Both approaches provide virtually the same results when the calibration process is precisely executed, which contradicts the results of previous studies.},

We collected over 190 wetland valuation studies, providing 215 value observations, in order to present a more comprehensive meta-analysis of the valuation literature that includes tropical wetlands (e.g., mangroves), estimates from diverse valuation methodologies, and a broader range of wetland services (e.g., biodiversity value). We also aim for a more comprehensive geographical coverage. We find that socio-economic variables, such as income and population density, that are often omitted from such analyses are important in explaining wetland value. We also assess the prospects for using this analysis for out-of-sample value transfer, and find average transfer errors of 74%, with just under one-fifth of the transfers showing errors of 10% or less.},

  abstract  = {A new global coastal database has been developed within the context of the DINAS-COAST project. The database covers the world's coasts, excluding Antarctica, and includes information on more than 80 physical, ecological, and socioeconomic parameters of the coastal zone. The database provides the base data for the Dynamic Interactive Vulnerability Assessment modelling tool that the DINAS-COAST project has produced. In order to comply with the requirements of the modelling tool, it is based on a data model in which all information is referenced to more than 12,000 linear coastal segments of variable length. For efficiency of data storage, six other geographic features (administrative units, countries, rivers, tidal basins or estuaries, world heritage sites, and climate grid cells) are used to reference some data, but all are linked to the linear segment structure. This fundamental linear data structure is unique for a global database and represents an efficient solution to the problem of representing and storing coastal data. The database has been specifically designed to support impact and vulnerability analysis to sea-level rise at a range of scales up to global. Due to the structure, consistency, user-friendliness, and wealth of information in the database, it has potential wider application to analysis and modelling of the world's coasts, especially at regional to global scales.},

  abstract = {Abstract Sea-level rise due to both climate change and non-climatic factors threatens coastal settlements, infrastructure, and ecosystems. Projections of mean global sea-level (GSL) rise provide insufficient information to plan adaptive responses; local decisions require local projections that accommodate different risk tolerances and time frames and that can be linked to storm surge projections. Here we present a global set of local sea-level (LSL) projections to inform decisions on timescales ranging from the coming decades through the 22nd century. We provide complete probability distributions, informed by a combination of expert community assessment, expert elicitation, and process modeling. Between the years 2000 and 2100, we project a very likely (90\% probability) GSL rise of 0.5–1.2 m under representative concentration pathway (RCP) 8.5, 0.4–0.9 m under RCP 4.5, and 0.3–0.8 m under RCP 2.6. Site-to-site differences in LSL projections are due to varying non-climatic background uplift or subsidence, oceanographic effects, and spatially variable responses of the geoid and the lithosphere to shrinking land ice. The Antarctic ice sheet (AIS) constitutes a growing share of variance in GSL and LSL projections. In the global average and at many locations, it is the dominant source of variance in late 21st century projections, though at some sites oceanographic processes contribute the largest share throughout the century. LSL rise dramatically reshapes flood risk, greatly increasing the expected number of “1-in-10” and “1-in-100” year events.},

  abstract = {The usual interpolation method is that of Lagrange. The disadvantage of the method is that in the given points the derivatives of the interpolating polynomials are not equal one to the other. In the method of Hermite, polynomials of a higher degree are used, whose derivatives in the given points are supposed to be equal to the derivatives of the function at the given points. This means that those derivatives must be known. If those derivatives are not known, then in the given points the derivatives may be replaced by approximative values, e.g. based on the interpolating polynomials of Lagrange. Such a method has been described by T. B. Sprague (1880) and in a simplified form by J. Karup (1898). In this paper the formulae are derived. Both methods are illustrated with an example. Some properties and theorems are stated. Tables to simplify the computational work are given. Subroutines for these interpolation methods will be published in a next article.},

An exact relationship between marginal q and average q is also derived. Marginal q adjusted for tax parameters is then calculated from data on average q assuming the actual U.S. tax system concerning corporate tax rate and depreciation allowances.},

  abstract  = {This study contributes to a better understanding of synergies and trade-offs between climate mitigation and sustainable development
goals, covering 17 indicators across various SDGs. Our assessment employs a multi-model framework, which includes a global
computable general equilibrium model (ENVISAGE), an energy system model (KINESYS) and an atmospheric source-receptor model
(TM5-FASST). This combination of modeling tools allows us to provide a detailed representation of the energy-related SDG indicators while accounting for
their interactions with climate mitigation and socio-economic dimensions. We find that out of 17 analyzed SDG indicators, seven experience
co-benefits from implementing mitigation efforts (including improved environmental footprints, energy efficiency and clean energy), six SDG indicators are
subject to trade-offs (energy and food affordability, economic growth and labor participation), while the remaining four SDG indicators show
mixed trends (distributional aspects and energy diversity). The identified trade-offs could be substantially reduced through specific policy solutions.
We find that if the revenue collected from carbon pricing is recycled via reductions in factor taxes in selected low-carbon activities, as
opposed to lump-sum payments to households, 11 out of 13 SDG dimensions analyzed in this regard would improve---reducing energy prices, increasing
the share of renewable energy, improving distributional outcomes and decreasing welfare losses. In addition, we showcase the need for properly capturing interactions
across various SDG dimensions by monetizing the co-benefits from improved air quality. We find that such co-benefits outweigh mitigation costs by more
than a factor of two, thus changing trade-offs earlier identified for the case of economic growth into synergies. A higher ratio of air quality
co-benefits relative to mitigation costs observed for developing countries could also lead to reductions in between-country inequality.},

  abstract  = {This article examines how international trade and policy shape the economic consequences of climate-induced changes in crop productivity, considering both adaptation and mitigation. International trade serves as a global risk-sharing mechanism with the potential of ameliorating the adverse impacts of climate-induced crop shortages by allowing regions with agricultural surpluses to provide for those facing shortages. However, the effectiveness of trade in adaptation depends on whether changes in productivity occur in the short- or the long-run, the structure of tariffs and subsidies, and whether a country is a net importer or exporter of affected products. The most recent evidence on long-term adaptation suggests that the changes in domestic crop portfolios and a diversified set of suppliers are the most effective ways for food-dependent countries to adapt to projected changes in climate toward the mid-century. In the short term, trade helps to buffer against seasonal price shocks, offering relief from sudden price spikes in food staples. Concerns about importing price volatility have little support in the historical record. Still, they may be justified as shifts in climate may result in more frequent extreme events affecting large producing regions of the world. Emerging international trade policies aimed at climate change mitigation, such as carbon border adjustments and laws banning trade in products associated with deforestation, are gaining traction. The adaptability of the international trade regime to these policies remains uncertain. Critical areas for further research include moving from impact assessment to analyzing how the current structure of farm programs worldwide interacts with adaptation and mitigation strategies, expanding the range of crops, and including livestock products in the analysis.},
